<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>In presenting this treatise on &#8220;Aviation Engines,&#8221;
the writer realizes that the rapidly developing art makes
it difficult to outline all latest forms or describe all
current engineering practice. This exposition has been
prepared primarily for instruction purposes and is adapted
for men in the Aviation Section, Signal Corps, and
students who wish to become aviators or aviation mechanicians.
Every effort has been made to have the engineering
information accurate, but owing to the diversity
of authorities consulted and use of data translated from
foreign language periodicals, it is expected that some
slight errors will be present. The writer wishes to acknowledge
his indebtedness to such firms as the Curtiss
Aeroplane and Motor Co., Hall-Scott Company, Thomas-Morse
Aircraft Corporation and General Vehicle Company
for photographs and helpful descriptive matter.
Special attention has been paid to instructions on tool
equipment, use of tools, trouble &#8220;shooting&#8221; and engine
repairs, as it is on these points that the average aviation
student is weakest. Only such theoretical consideration
of thermo-dynamics as was deemed absolutely necessary
to secure a proper understanding of engine action after
consulting several instructors is included, the writer&#8217;s
efforts having been confined to the preparation of a
practical series of instructions that would be of the
greatest value to those who need a diversified knowledge
of internal-combustion engine operation and repair, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
who must acquire it quickly. The engines described and
illustrated are all practical forms that have been fitted to
airplanes capable of making flights and may be considered
fairly representative of the present state of the art.</p>

<h3><a name="SecI_1" id="SecI_1"></a>BRIEF CONSIDERATION OF AIRCRAFT TYPES</h3>

<p>The conquest of the air is one of the most stupendous
achievements of the ages. Human flight opens the sky
to man as a new road, and because it is a road free of all
obstructions and leads everywhere, affording the shortest
distance to any place, it offers to man the prospect of
unlimited freedom. The aircraft promises to span continents
like railroads, to bridge seas like ships, to go over
mountains and forests like birds, and to quicken and
simplify the problems of transportation. While the actual
conquest of the air is an accomplishment just being realized
in our days, the idea and yearning to conquer the air
are old, possibly as old as intellect itself. The myths of
different races tell of winged gods and flying men, and
show that for ages to fly was the highest conception of
the sublime. No other agent is more responsible for sustained
flight than the internal combustion motor, and it
was only when this form of prime mover had been fully
developed that it was possible for man to leave the ground
and alight at will, not depending upon the caprices of
the winds or lifting power of gases as with the balloon.
It is safe to say that the solution of the problem of flight
would have been attained many years ago if the proper
source of power had been available as all the essential<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
elements of the modern aeroplane and dirigible balloon,
other than the power plant, were known to early philosophers
and scientists.</p>

<p>Aeronautics is divided into two fundamentally different
branches&mdash;aviatics and aerostatics. The first comprises
all types of aeroplanes and heavier than air flying
machines such as the helicopters, kites, etc.; the second
includes dirigible balloons, passive balloons and all craft
which rise in the air by utilizing the lifting force of gases.
Aeroplanes are the only practical form of heavier-than-air
machines, as the helicopters (machines intended to be
lifted directly into the air by propellers, without the sustaining
effect of planes), and ornithopters, or flapping
wing types, have not been thoroughly developed, and in
fact, there are so many serious mechanical problems to
be solved before either of these types of air craft will
function properly that experts express grave doubts regarding
the practicability of either. Aeroplanes are divided
into two main types&mdash;monoplanes or single surface
forms, and bi-planes or machines having two sets of lifting
surfaces, one suspended over the other. A third type,
the triplane, is not very widely used.</p>

<p>Dirigible balloons are divided into three classes: the
rigid, the semi-rigid, and the non-rigid. The rigid has a
frame or skeleton of either wood or metal inside of the
bag, to stiffen it; the semi-rigid is reinforced by a wire
net and metal attachments; while the non-rigid is just a
bag filled with gas. The aeroplane, more than the dirigible
and balloon, stands as the emblem of the conquest of the
air. Two reasons for this are that power flight is a real
conquest of the air, a real victory over the battling elements;
secondly, because the aeroplane, or any flying machine
that may follow, brings air travel within the reach
of everybody. In practical development, the dirigible may
be the steamship of the air, which will render invaluable
services of a certain kind, and the aeroplane will be the
automobile of the air, to be used by the multitude, perhaps
for as many purposes as the automobile is now being used.</p>

<p class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></p>
<h3><a name="SecI_2" id="SecI_2"></a>ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS OF AERIAL MOTORS</h3>

<p>One of the marked features of aircraft development has
been the effect it has had upon the refinement and perfection
of the internal combustion motor. Without question
gasoline-motors intended for aircraft are the nearest to
perfection of any other type yet evolved. Because of the
peculiar demands imposed upon the aeronautical motor it
must possess all the features of reliability, economy and
efficiency now present with automobile or marine engines
and then must have distinctive points of its own. Owing
to the unstable nature of the medium through which it is
operated and the fact that heavier-than-air machines can
maintain flight only as long as the power plant is functioning
properly, an airship motor must be more reliable
than any used on either land or water. While a few
pounds of metal more or less makes practically no difference
in a marine motor and has very little effect upon
the speed or hill-climbing ability of an automobile, an
airship motor must be as light as it is possible to make
it because every pound counts, whether the motor is to be
fitted into an aeroplane or in a dirigible balloon.</p>

<p>Airship motors, as a rule, must operate constantly at
high speeds in order to obtain a maximum power delivery
with a minimum piston displacement. In automobiles, or
motor boats, motors are not required to run constantly at
their maximum speed. Most aircraft motors must function
for extended periods at speed as nearly the maximum
as possible. Another thing that militates against the aircraft
motor is the more or less unsteady foundation to
which it is attached. The necessarily light framework of the
aeroplane makes it hard for a motor to perform at maximum
efficiency on account of the vibration of its foundation
while the craft is in flight. Marine and motor car engines,
while not placed on foundations as firm as those provided
for stationary power plants, are installed on bases of much
more stability than the light structure of an aeroplane.
The aircraft motor, therefore, must be balanced to a nicety<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
and must run steadily under the most unfavorable conditions.</p>

<h3><a name="SecI_3" id="SecI_3"></a>AERIAL MOTORS MUST BE LIGHT</h3>

<p>The capacity of light motors designed for aerial work
per unit of mass is surprising to those not fully conversant
with the possibilities that a thorough knowledge
of proportions of parts and the use of special metals
developed by the automobile industry make possible. Activity
in the development of light motors has been more
pronounced in France than in any other country. Some
of these motors have been complicated types made light
by the skillful proportioning of parts, others are of the
refined simpler form modified from current automobile
practice. There is a tendency to depart from the freakish
or unconventional construction and to adhere more closely
to standard forms because it is necessary to have the parts
of such size that every quality making for reliability,
efficiency and endurance are incorporated in the design.
Aeroplane motors range from two cylinders to forms having
fourteen and sixteen cylinders and the arrangement
of these members varies from the conventional vertical
tandem and opposed placing to the V form or the more
unusual radial motors having either fixed or rotary cylinders.
The weight has been reduced so it is possible to
obtain a complete power plant of the revolving cylinder
air-cooled type that will not weigh more than three pounds
per actual horse-power and in some cases less than this.</p>

<p>If we give brief consideration to the requirements of
the aviator it will be evident that one of the most important
is securing maximum power with minimum mass,
and it is desirable to conserve all of the good qualities
existing in standard automobile motors. These are certainty
of operation, good mechanical balance and uniform
delivery of power&mdash;fundamental conditions which must be
attained before a power plant can be considered practical.
There are in addition, secondary considerations, none the
less desirable, if not absolutely essential. These are minimum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
consumption of fuel and lubricating oil, which is
really a factor of import, for upon the economy depends
the capacity and flying radius. As the amount of liquid
fuel must be limited the most suitable motor will be that
which is powerful and at the same time economical. Another
important feature is to secure accessibility of components
in order to make easy repair or adjustment of
parts possible. It is possible to obtain sufficiently light-weight
motors without radical departure from established
practice. Water-cooled power plants have been designed
that will weigh but four or five pounds per horse-power
and in these forms we have a practical power plant
capable of extended operation.</p>

<h3><a name="SecI_4" id="SecI_4"></a>FACTORS INFLUENCING POWER NEEDED</h3>

<p>Work is performed whenever an object is moved against
a resistance, and the amount of work performed depends
not only on the amount of resistance overcome but also
upon the amount of time utilized in accomplishing a given
task. Work is measured in horse-power for convenience.
It will take one horse-power to move 33,000 pounds one
foot in one minute or 550 pounds one foot in one second.
The same work would be done if 330 pounds were moved
100 feet in one minute. It requires a definite amount of
power to move a vehicle over the ground at a certain
speed, so it must take power to overcome resistance of
an airplane in the air. Disregarding the factor of air
density, it will take more power as the speed increases
if the weight or resistance remains constant, or more
power if the speed remains constant and the resistance
increases. The airplane is supported by air reaction under
the planes or lifting surfaces and the value of this
reaction depends upon the shape of the aerofoil, the
amount it is tilted and the speed at which it is drawn
through the air. The angle of incidence or degree of
wing tilt regulates the power required to a certain degree
as this affects the speed of horizontal flight as well as the
resistance. Resistance may be of two kinds, one that is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
necessary and the other that it is desirable to reduce to
the lowest point possible. There is the wing resistance
and the sum of the resistances of the rest of the machine
such as fuselage, struts, wires, landing gear, etc. If we
assume that a certain airplane offered a total resistance
of 300 pounds and we wished to drive it through the air
at a speed of sixty miles per hour, we can find the horse-power
needed by a very simple computation as follows:</p>

<table class="formula" summary="formula p 22-1">

<tr>
<td class="center bb">The product of 300 pounds resistance times speed of 88 feet<br />
per second times 60 seconds in a minute</td>
<td rowspan="2" class="left">&nbsp;=&nbsp;H.P.&nbsp;needed.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="center">divided by 33,000 foot pounds per minute<br />
in one horse-power</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>The result is the horse-power needed, or</p>

<table class="formula" summary="formula p 22-2">

<tr>
<td class="center bb">300 &times; 88 &times; 60</td>
<td rowspan="2" class="left">&nbsp;= 48 H.P.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="center">33,000</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>Just as it takes more power to climb a hill than it does
to run a car on the level, it takes more power to climb
in the air with an airplane than it does to fly on the level.
The more rapid the climb, the more power it will take.
If the resistance remains 300 pounds and it is necessary
to drive the plane at 90 miles per hour, we merely substitute
proper values in the above formula and we have</p>

<table class="formula" summary="table p 22-3">

<tr>
<td class="center bb">300 pounds times 132 feet per second times 60<br />
seconds in a minute</td>
<td rowspan="2">&nbsp;= 72 H.P.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="center">33,000 foot pounds per minute in one<br />
horse-power</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>The same results can be obtained by dividing the product
of the resistance in pounds times speed in feet per second
by 550, which is the foot-pounds of work done in one
second to equal one horse-power. Naturally, the amount
of propeller thrust measured in pounds necessary to drive
an airplane must be greater than the resistance by a substantial
margin if the plane is to fly and climb as well.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
The following formul&aelig; were given in &#8220;The Aeroplane&#8221;
of London and can be used to advantage by those desiring
to make computations to ascertain power requirements:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="Fig001" id="Fig001"></a>
<img src="images/illo018.png" alt="Fig. 1" width="400" height="519" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 1.&mdash;Diagrams Illustrating Computations for Horse-Power Required for
Airplane Flight.</p></div>

<p>The thrust of the propeller depends on the power of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the motor, and on the diameter and pitch of the propeller.
If the required thrust to a certain machine is known, the
calculation for the horse-power of the motor should be an
easy matter.</p>

<p>The required thrust is the sum of three different &#8220;resistances.&#8221;
The first is the &#8220;drift&#8221; (dynamical head resistance
of the aerofoils), i.e., tan &#945; &times; lift (<i>L</i>), lift being
equal to the total weight of machine (<i>W</i>) for horizontal
flight and &#945; equal to the angle of incidence. Certainly we
must take the tan &#945; at the maximum <i>K<sub>y</sub></i> value for minimum
speed, as then the drift is the greatest (<a href="#Fig001">Fig. 1</a>, A).</p>

<p>Another method for finding the drift is <i>D</i> = <i>K</i> &times; <i>AV</i><sup>2</sup>,
when we take the drift again so as to be greatest.</p>

<p>The second &#8220;resistance&#8221; is the total head resistance
of the machine, at its maximum velocity. And the third
is the thrust for climbing. The horse-power for climbing
can be found out in two different ways. I first propose
to deal with the method, where we find out the actual
horse-power wanted for a certain climbing speed to our
machine, where</p>

<table class="formula" summary="formula p 24-1">

<tr>
<td rowspan="2" class="left">&nbsp;H.P. =&nbsp;</td>
<td class="center bb">climbing speed/sec. &times; <i>W</i></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="center">550</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>In this case we know already the horse-power for climbing,
and we can proceed with our calculation.</p>

<p>With the other method we shall find out the &#8220;thrust&#8221;
in pounds or kilograms wanted for climbing and add it
to drift and total head resistance, and we shall have the
total &#8220;thrust&#8221; of our machine and we shall denote it
with <i>T</i>, while thrust for climbing shall be <i>T<sub>c</sub></i>.</p>

<p>The following calculation is at our service to find out
this thrust for climbing</p>

<p>The computations and formul&aelig; given are of most value
to the student engineer rather than matters of general
interest, but are given so that a general idea may be
secured of how airplane design influences power needed
to secure sustained flight. It will be apparent that the
resistance of an airplane depends upon numerous considerations
of design which require considerable research
in aerodynamics to determine accurately. It is obvious
that the more resistance there is, the more power needed
to fly at a given speed. Light monoplanes have been
flown with as little as 15 horse-power for short distances,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
but most planes now built use engines of 100 horse-power
or more. Giant airplanes have been constructed having
2,000 horse-power distributed in four power units. The
amount of power provided for an airplane of given design
varies widely as many conditions govern this, but it will
range from approximately one horse-power to each 8
pounds weight in the case of very light, fast machines
to one horse-power to 15 or 18 pounds of the total weight
in the case of medium speed machines. The development
in airplane and power plant design is so rapid, however,
that the figures given can be considered only in the light
of general averages rather than being typical of current
practice.</p>

<h3><a name="SecI_5" id="SecI_5"></a>WHY EXPLOSIVE MOTORS ARE BEST</h3>

<p>Internal combustion engines are best for airplanes and
all types of aircraft for the same reasons that they are
universally used as a source of power for automobiles.
The gasoline engine is the lightest known form of prime
mover and a more efficient one than a steam engine, especially
in the small powers used for airplane propulsion.
It has been stated that by very careful designing
a steam plant an engine could be made that would be
practical for airplane propulsion, but even with the latest
development it is doubtful if steam power can be utilized
in aircraft to as good advantage as modern gasoline-engines
are. While the steam-engine is considered very
much simpler than a gas-motor, the latter is much more
easily mastered by the non-technical aviator and certainly
requires less attention. A weight of 10 pounds per horse-power
is possible in a condensing steam plant but this
figure is nearly double or triple what is easily secured
with a gas-motor which may weigh but 5 pounds per horse-power
in the water cooled forms and but 2 or 3 pounds
in the air-cooled types. The fuel consumption is twice
as great in a steam-power plant (owing to heat losses)
as would be the case in a gasoline engine of equal power
and much less weight.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>The internal-combustion engine has come seemingly
like an avalanche of a decade; but it has come to stay,
to take its well-deserved position among the powers for
aiding labor. Its ready adaptation to road, aerial and
marine service has made it a wonder of the age in the
development of speed not before dreamed of as a possibility;
yet in so short a time, its power for speed has
taken rank on the common road against the locomotive
on the rail with its century&#8217;s progress. It has made aerial
navigation possible and practical, it furnishes power for
all marine craft from the light canoe to the transatlantic
liner. It operates the machine tools of the mechanic, tills
the soil for the farmer and provides healthful recreation
for thousands by furnishing an economical means of transport
by land and sea. It has been a universal mechanical
education for the masses, and in its present forms represents
the great refinement and development made possible
by the concentration of the world&#8217;s master minds on the
problems incidental to internal combustion engineering.</p>

<h3><a name="SecI_6" id="SecI_6"></a>HISTORICAL</h3>

<p>Although the ideal principle of explosive power was
conceived some two hundred years ago, at which time
experiments were made with gunpowder as the explosive
element, it was not until the last years of the eighteenth
century that the idea took a patentable shape, and not
until about 1826 (Brown&#8217;s gas-vacuum engine) that a further
progress was made in England by condensing the
products of combustion by a jet of water, thus creating
a partial vacuum.</p>

<p>Brown&#8217;s was probably the first explosive engine that
did real work. It was clumsy and unwieldy and was soon
relegated to its place among the failures of previous experiments.
No approach to active explosive effect in a
cylinder was reached in practice, although many ingenious
designs were described, until about 1838 and the following
years. Barnett&#8217;s engine in England was the first attempt
to compress the charge before exploding. From this time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
on to about 1860 many patents were issued in Europe and
a few in the United States for gas-engines, but the progress
was slow, and its practical introduction for power
came with spasmodic effect and low efficiency. From 1860
on, practical improvement seems to have been made, and
the Lenoir motor was produced in France and brought
to the United States. It failed to meet expectations, and
was soon followed by further improvements in the Hugon
motor in France (1862), followed by Beau de Rocha&#8217;s
four-cycle idea, which has been slowly developed through
a long series of experimental trials by different inventors.
In the hands of Otto and Langdon a further progress was
made, and numerous patents were issued in England,
France, and Germany, and followed up by an increasing
interest in the United States, with a few patents.</p>

<p>From 1870 improvements seem to have advanced at
a steady rate, and largely in the valve-gear and precision
of governing for variable load. The early idea of the necessity
of slow combustion was a great drawback in the
advancement of efficiency, and the suggestion of de Rocha
in 1862 did not take root as a prophetic truth until many
failures and years of experience had taught the fundamental
axiom that rapidity of action in both combustion
and expansion was the basis of success in explosive motors.</p>

<p>With this truth and the demand for small and safe
prime movers, the manufacture of gas-engines increased
in Europe and America at a more rapid rate, and improvements
in perfecting the details of this cheap and efficient
prime mover have finally raised it to the dignity of a
standard motor and a dangerous rival of the steam-engine
for small and intermediate powers, with a prospect of
largely increasing its individual units to many hundred,
if not to the thousand horse-power in a single cylinder.
The unit size in a single cylinder has now reached to about
700 horse-power and by combining cylinders in the same
machine, powers of from 1,500 to 2,000 horse-power are
now available for large power-plants.</p>

<h3><a name="SecI_7" id="SecI_7"></a>MAIN TYPES OF INTERNAL-COMBUSTION ENGINES</h3>

<p>This form of prime mover has been built in so many
different types, all of which have operated with some
degree of success that the diversity in form will not be
generally appreciated unless some attempt is made to
classify the various designs that have received practical
application. Obviously the same type of engine is not
universally applicable, because each class of work has
individual peculiarities which can best be met by an engine
designed with the peculiar conditions present in view.
The following tabular synopsis will enable the reader to
judge the extent of the development of what is now the
most popular prime mover for all purposes.</p>

and Refined Design, Showing Great Power Outputs for Very Small
Weight, a Feature Very Much Desired in Airplane Power Plants.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>Of all the types enumerated above engines having less
than eight cylinders are the most popular in everything
but aircraft work. The four-cylinder vertical is without
doubt the most widely used of all types owing to the
large number employed as automobile power plants.
Stationary engines in small and medium powers are invariably
of the single or double form. Three-cylinder
engines are seldom used at the present time, except in
marine work and in some stationary forms. Eight- and
twelve-cylinder motors have received but limited application
and practically always in automobiles, racing motor
boats or in aircraft. The only example of a fourteen-cylinder
motor to be used to any extent is incorporated
in aeroplane construction. This is also true of the sixteen- and
eighteen-cylinder forms and of twenty-four-cylinder
engines now in process of development.</p>

<p>The duty an engine is designed for determines the
weight per horse-power. High powered engines intended
for steady service are always of the slow speed type and
consequently are of very massive construction. Various
forms of heavy duty type stationary engines are shown
at <a href="#Fig002">Fig. 2</a>. Some of these engines may weigh as much as
600 pounds per horse-power. A further study is possible
by consulting data given on <a href="#Fig003">Figs. 3</a> and <a href="#Fig004">4</a>. As the crank-shaft
speed increases and cylinders are multiplied the
engines become lighter. While the big stationary power
plants may run for years without attention, airplane engines
require rebuilding after about 60 to 80 hours air
service for the fixed cylinder types and 40 hours or less
for the rotary cylinder air-cooled forms. There is evidently
a decrease in durability and reliability as the
weight is lessened. These illustrations also permit of
obtaining a good idea of the variety of forms internal
combustion engines are made in.</p>

<h3><a name="SecII_1" id="SecII_1"></a>OPERATING PRINCIPLES OF TWO- AND FOUR-STROKE
CYCLE ENGINES</h3>

<p>Before discussing the construction of the various forms
of internal combustion engines it may be well to describe
the operating cycle of the types most generally used.
The two-cycle engine is the simplest because there are no
valves in connection with the cylinder, as the gas is introduced
into that member and expelled from it through
ports cored into the cylinder walls. These are covered by
the piston at a certain portion of its travel and uncovered
at other parts of its stroke. In the four-cycle engine
the explosive gas is admitted to the cylinder through a
port at the head end closed by a valve, while the exhaust
gas is expelled through another port controlled in a similar
manner. These valves are operated by mechanism
distinct from the piston.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 6.&mdash;Outlining Second Two Strokes of Piston in Four-Cycle Engine.</p></div>

<p><a name="SecII_2" id="SecII_2"></a>The action of the four-cycle type may be easily understood
if one refers to illustrations at <a href="#Fig005">Figs. 5</a> and <a href="#Fig006">6</a>. It
is called the &#8220;four-stroke engine&#8221; because the piston must
make four strokes in the cylinder for each explosion or
power impulse obtained. The principle of the gas-engine
of the internal combustion type is similar to that of a
gun, i.e., power is obtained by the rapid combustion of
some explosive or other quick burning substance. The
bullet is driven out of the gun barrel by the pressure of
the gas evolved when the charge of powder is ignited.
The piston or movable element of the gas-engine is driven<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
from the closed or head end to the crank end of the
cylinder by a similar expansion of gases resulting from
combustion. The first operation in firing a gun or securing
an explosion in the cylinder of the gas-engine is to
fill the combustion space with combustible material. This
is done by a down stroke of the piston during which time
the inlet valve opens to admit the gaseous charge to the
cylinder interior. This operation is shown at <a href="#Fig005">Fig. 5</a>, A.
The second operation is to compress this gas which is
done by an upward stroke of the piston as shown at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
<a href="#Fig005">Fig. 5</a>, B. When the top of the compression stroke is reached,
the gas is ignited and the piston is driven down toward
the open end of the cylinder, as indicated at <a href="#Fig006">Fig. 6</a>, C. The
fourth operation or exhaust stroke is performed by the
return upward movement of the piston as shown at <a href="#Fig006">Fig.
6</a>, D during which time the exhaust valve is opened to
permit the burnt gases to leave the cylinder. As soon
as the piston reaches the top of its exhaust stroke, the
energy stored in the fly-wheel rim during the power stroke
causes that member to continue revolving and as the piston<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a></span>
again travels on its down stroke the inlet valve opens and
admits a charge of fresh gas and the cycle of operations
is repeated.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="Fig007" id="Fig007"></a>
<img src="images/illo035.png" alt="Fig. 7" width="354" height="550" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 7.&mdash;Sectional View of L Head Gasoline Engine Cylinder Showing
Piston Movements During Four-Stroke Cycle.</p></div>

<p>The illustrations at <a href="#Fig007">Fig. 7</a> show how the various cycle
functions take place in an L head type water cooled cylinder
engine. The sections at A and C are taken through
the inlet valve, those at B and D are taken through the
exhaust valve.</p>

<p><a name="SecII_3" id="SecII_3"></a>The two-cycle engine works on a different principle, as
while only the combustion chamber end of the piston is
employed to do useful work in the four-cycle engine, both
upper and lower portions are called upon to perform the
functions necessary to two-cycle engine operation. Instead
of the gas being admitted into the cylinder as is the
case with the four-stroke engine, it is first drawn into the
engine base where it receives a preliminary compression
prior to its transfer to the working end of the cylinder.
The views at <a href="#Fig008">Fig. 8</a> should indicate clearly the operation
of the two-port two-cycle engine. At A the piston is
seen reaching the top of its stroke and the gas above the
piston is being compressed ready for ignition, while the
suction in the engine base causes the automatic valve to
open and admits mixture from the carburetor to the
crank case. When the piston reaches the top of its stroke,
the compressed gas is ignited and the piston is driven
down on the power stroke, compressing the gas in the
engine base.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 750px;"><a name="Fig008" id="Fig008"></a>
<img src="images/illo037.png" alt="Fig. 8" width="750" height="465" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 8.&mdash;Showing Two-port, Two-cycle Engine Operation.</p></div>

<p>When the top of the piston uncovers the exhaust port
the flaming gas escapes because of its pressure. A downward
movement of the piston uncovers the inlet port
opposite the exhaust and permits the fresh gas to bypass
through the transfer passage from the engine base to the
cylinder. The conditions with the intake and exhaust
port fully opened are clearly shown at <a href="#Fig008">Fig. 8</a>, C. The
deflector plate on the top of the piston directs the entering
fresh gas to the top of the cylinder and prevents the
main portion of the gas stream from flowing out through
the open exhaust port. On the next upstroke of the piston<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43"
id="Page_43"></a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a></span>
the gas in the cylinder is compressed and the inlet valve
opened, as shown at A to permit a fresh charge to enter
the engine base.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 750px;"><a name="Fig009" id="Fig009"></a>
<img src="images/illo038.png" alt="Fig. 9" width="750" height="464" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 9.&mdash;Defining Three-port, Two-cycle Engine Action.</p></div>

<p>The operating principle of the three-port, two-cycle
engine is practically the same as that previously described
with the exception that the gas is admitted to the crank-case
through a third port in the cylinder wall, which is
uncovered by the piston when that member reaches the
end of its upstroke. The action of the three-port form
can be readily ascertained by studying the diagrams given
at <a href="#Fig009">Fig. 9</a>. Combination two- and three-port engines have
been evolved and other modifications made to improve the
action.</p>

<h3><a name="SecII_4" id="SecII_4"></a>THE TWO-CYCLE AND FOUR-CYCLE TYPES</h3>

<p>In the earlier years of explosive-motor progress was
evolved the two types of motors in regard to the cycles
of their operation. The early attempts to perfect the
two-cycle principle were for many years held in abeyance
from the pressure of interests in the four-cycle type, until
its simplicity and power possibilities were demonstrated
by Mr. Dugald Clerk in England, who gave the principles
of the two-cycle motor a broad bearing leading to immediate
improvements in design, which has made further
progress in the United States, until at the present time
it has an equal standard value as a motor-power in some
applications as its ancient rival the four-cycle or Otto
type, as demonstrated by Beau de Rocha in 1862.</p>

<p>Thermodynamically, the methods of the two types are
equal as far as combustion is concerned, and compression
may favor in a small degree the four-cycle type as well
as the purity of the charge. The cylinder volume of the
two-cycle motor is much smaller per unit of power, and
the enveloping cylinder surface is therefore greater per
unit of volume. Hence more heat is carried off by the
jacket water during compression, and the higher compression
available from this tends to increase the economy
during compression which is lost during expansion.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>From the above considerations it may be safely stated
that a <i>lower</i> temperature and higher pressure of charge
at the beginning of compression is obtained in the two-cycle
motor, greater weight of charge and greater specific
power of higher compression resulting in higher thermal
efficiency. The smaller cylinder for the same power of
the two-cycle motor gives less friction surface per impulse
than of the other type; although the crank-chamber pressure
may, in a measure, balance the friction of the four-cycle
type. Probably the strongest points in favor of the
two-cycle type are the lighter fly-wheel and the absence
of valves and valve gear, making this type the most simple
in construction and the lightest in weight for its developed
power. Yet, for the larger power units, the four-cycle
type will no doubt always maintain the standard for
efficiency and durability of action.</p>

<p>The distribution of the charge and its degree of mixture
with the remains of the previous explosion in the
clearance space, has been a matter of discussion for both
types of explosive motors, with doubtful results. In <a href="#Fig010">Fig.
10</a>, A we illustrate what theory suggests as to the distribution
of the fresh charge in a two-cycle motor, and in <a href="#Fig010">Fig.
10</a>, B what is the probable distribution of the mixture when
the piston starts on its compressive stroke. The arrows
show the probable direction of flow of the fresh charge
and burnt gases at the crucial moment.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Fig010">Fig. 10</a>, C is shown the complete out-sweep of the
products of combustion for the full extent of the piston
stroke of a four-cycle motor, leaving only the volume of
the clearance to mix with the new charge and at D the
manner by which the new charge sweeps by the ignition
device, keeping it cool and avoiding possibilities of pre-ignition
by undue heating of the terminals of the sparking
device. Thus, by enveloping the sparking device with
the pure mixture, ignition spreads through the charge with
its greatest possible velocity, a most desirable condition
in high-speed motors with side-valve chambers and igniters
within the valve chamber.</p>

<h3><a name="SecII_5" id="SecII_5"></a>THEORY OF THE GAS AND GASOLINE ENGINE</h3>

<p>The laws controlling the elements that create a power
by their expansion by heat due to combustion, when properly
understood, become a matter of computation in
regard to their value as an agent for generating power
in the various kinds of explosive engines. The method
of heating the elements of power in explosive engines
greatly widens the limits of temperature as available in
other types of heat-engines. It disposes of many of the
practical troubles of hot-air, and even of steam-engines,
in the simplicity and directness of application of the elements
of power. In the explosive engine the difficulty
of conveying heat for producing expansive effect by convection
is displaced by the generation of the required heat
within the expansive element and at the instant of its
useful work. The low conductivity of heat to and from
air has been the great obstacle in the practical development
of the hot-air engine; while, on the contrary, it has
become the source of economy and practicability in the
development of the internal-combustion engine.</p>

<p>The action of air, gas, and the vapors of gasoline and
petroleum oil, whether singly or mixed, is affected by
changes of temperature practically in nearly the same
ratio; but when the elements that produce combustion are
interchanged in confined spaces, there is a marked difference
of effect. The oxygen of the air, the hydrogen and
carbon of a gas, or vapor of gasoline or petroleum oil are
the elements that by combustion produce heat to expand
the nitrogen of the air and the watery vapor produced
by the union of the oxygen in the air and the hydrogen in
the gas, as well as also the monoxide and carbonic-acid
gas that may be formed by the union of the carbon of
gas or vapor with part of the oxygen of the air. The
various mixtures as between air and gas, or air and vapor,
with the proportion of the products of combustion left
in the cylinder from a previous combustion, form the
elements to be considered in estimating the amount of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
pressure that may be obtained by their combustion and
expansive force.</p>

<h3><a name="SecII_6" id="SecII_6"></a>EARLY GAS ENGINE FORMS</h3>

<p>The working process of the explosive motor may be
divided into three principal types: 1. Motors with charges
igniting at constant volume without compression, such as
the Lenoir, Hugon, and other similar types now abandoned
as wasteful in fuel and effect. 2. Motors with charges
igniting at constant pressure with compression, in which
a receiver is charged by a pump and the gases burned
while being admitted to the motor cylinder, such as types
of the Simon and Brayton engine. 3. Motors with charges
igniting at constant volume with variable compression,
such as the later two- and four-cycle motors with compression
of the indrawn charge; limited in the two-cycle type
and variable in the four-cycle type with the ratios of the
clearance space in the cylinder. This principle produces
the explosive motor of greatest efficiency.</p>

<p>The phenomena of the brilliant light and its accompanying
heat at the moment of explosion have been witnessed
in the experiments of Dugald Clerk in England,
the illumination lasting throughout the stroke; but in
regard to time in a four-cycle engine, the incandescent
state exists only one-quarter of the running time. Thus
the time interval, together with the non-conductibility of
the gases, makes the phenomena of a high-temperature
combustion within the comparatively cool walls of a cylinder
a practical possibility.</p>

<h3><a name="SecII_7" id="SecII_7"></a>THE ISOTHERMAL LAW</h3>

<p>The natural laws, long since promulgated by Boyle,
Gay Lussac, and others, on the subject of the expansion
and compression of gases by force and by heat, and their
variable pressures and temperatures when confined, are
conceded to be practically true and applicable to all gases,
whether single, mixed, or combined.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>The law formulated by Boyle only relates to the compression
and expansion of gases without a change of
temperature, and is stated in these words:</p>

<p><i>If the temperature of a gas be kept constant, its pressure
or elastic force will vary inversely as the volume
it occupies.</i></p>

<p>It is expressed in the formula P &times; V = C, or pressure
&times; volume = constant. Hence, C/P = V and C/V = P.</p>

<p>Thus the curve formed by increments of pressure during
the expansion or compression of a given volume of
gas without change of temperature is designated as the
isothermal curve in which the volume multiplied by the
pressure is a constant value in expansion, and inversely
the pressure divided by the volume is a constant value
in compressing a gas.</p>

<p>But as compression and expansion of gases require
force for their accomplishment mechanically, or by the
application or abstraction of heat chemically, or by convection,
a second condition becomes involved, which was
formulated into a law of thermodynamics by Gay Lussac
under the following conditions: A given volume of gas
under a free piston expands by heat and contracts by the
loss of heat, its volume causing a proportional movement
of a free piston equal to <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>273</sub> part of the cylinder volume
for each degree Centigrade difference in temperature, or
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>492</sub> part of its volume for each degree Fahrenheit. With
a fixed piston (constant volume), the pressure is increased
or decreased by an increase or decrease of heat in the
same proportion of <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>273</sub> part of its pressure for each
degree Centigrade, or <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>492</sub> part of its pressure for each
degree Fahrenheit change in temperature. This is the
natural sequence of the law of mechanical equivalent,
which is a necessary deduction from the principle that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
nothing in nature can be lost or wasted, for all the heat
that is imparted to or abstracted from a gaseous body
must be accounted for, either as heat or its equivalent
transformed into some other form of energy. In the case
of a piston moving in a cylinder by the expansive force
of heat in a gaseous body, all the heat expended in expansion
of the gas is turned into work; the balance must
be accounted for in absorption by the cylinder or radiation.</p>

<h3><a name="SecII_8" id="SecII_8"></a>THE ADIABATIC LAW</h3>

<p>This theory is equally applicable to the cooling of gases
by abstraction of heat or by cooling due to expansion by
the motion of a piston. The denominators of these heat
fractions of expansion or contraction represent the absolute
zero of cold below the freezing-point of water, and
read <span class="nowrap">-273&deg;</span> C. or <span class="nowrap">-492.66&deg;</span> =
<span class="nowrap">-460.66&deg;</span> F. below zero;
and these are the starting-points of reference in computing
the heat expansion in gas-engines. According to
Boyle&#8217;s law, called the first law of gases, there are but
two characteristics of a gas and their variations to be
considered, <i>viz</i>., volume and pressure: while by the law
of Gay Lussac, called the second law of gases, a third
is added, consisting of the value of the absolute temperature,
counting from absolute zero to the temperatures
at which the operations take place. This is the <i>Adiabatic</i>
law.</p>

<p>The ratio of the variation of the three conditions&mdash;volume,
pressure, and heat&mdash;from the absolute zero temperature
has a certain rate, in which the volume multiplied
by the pressure and the product divided by the
absolute temperature equals the ratio of expansion for
each degree. If a volume of air is contained in a cylinder
having a piston and fitted with an indicator, the piston,
if moved to and fro slowly, will alternately compress and
expand the air, and the indicator pencil will trace a line
or lines upon the card, which lines register the change
of pressure and volume occurring in the cylinder. If the
piston is perfectly free from leakage, and it be supposed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
that the temperature of the air is kept quite constant,
then the line so traced is called an <i>Isothermal line</i>, and
the pressure at any point when multiplied by the volume
is a constant, according to Boyle&#8217;s law,</p>

<p class="ind5"><i>pv</i> = a constant.</p>

<p>If, however, the piston is moved very rapidly, the air will
not remain at constant temperature, but the temperature
will increase because work has been done upon the air,
and the heat has no time to escape by conduction. If no
heat whatever is lost by any cause, the line will be traced
over and over again by the indicator pencil, the cooling
by expansion doing work precisely equalling the heating
by compression. This is the line of no transmission of
heat, therefore known as <i>Adiabatic</i>.</p>

<p>The expansion of a gas <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>273</sub> of its volume for every
degree Centigrade, added to its temperature, is equal to
the decimal .00366, the coefficient of expansion for Centigrade
units. To any given volume of a gas, its expansion
may be computed by multiplying the coefficient by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
number of degrees, and by reversing the process the degree
of acquired heat may be obtained approximately. These
methods are not strictly in conformity with the absolute
mathematical formula, because there is a small increase
in the increment of expansion of a dry gas, and there is
also a slight difference in the increment of expansion due
to moisture in the atmosphere and to the vapor of water
formed by the union of the hydrogen and oxygen in the
combustion chamber of explosive engines.</p>

<h3><a name="SecII_9" id="SecII_9"></a>TEMPERATURE COMPUTATIONS</h3>

<p>The ratio of expansion on the Fahrenheit scale is derived
from the absolute temperature below the freezing-point
of water <span class="nowrap">(32&deg;)</span> to correspond with the Centigrade
scale; therefore <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>492.66</sub> = .0020297, the ratio of expansion
from <span class="nowrap">32&deg;</span> for each degree rise in temperature on the Fahrenheit
scale. As an example, if the temperature of any
volume of air or gas at constant volume is raised, say
from <span class="nowrap">60&deg;</span> to <span class="nowrap">2000&deg;</span> F., the increase in temperature will be
<span class="nowrap">1940&deg;.</span> The ratio will be <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>520.66</sub> = .0019206. Then by the
formula:</p>

<p>Ratio &times; acquired temp. &times; initial pressure = the gauge
pressure; and .0019206 &times; <span class="nowrap">1940&deg;</span> &times; 14.7 = 54.77 lbs.</p>

<p>By another formula, a convenient ratio is obtained by
(absolute pressure)/(absolute temp.) or <sup>14.7</sup>&#8260;<sub>520.66</sub> = .028233; then, using the difference
of temperature as before, .028233 &times; <span class="nowrap">1940&deg;</span> = 54.77
lbs. pressure.</p>

<p>the theoretical heat of combustion.
The dropping of terminal decimals makes a small
decimal difference in the result in the different formulas.</p>

<h3><a name="SecII_10" id="SecII_10"></a>HEAT AND ITS WORK</h3>

<p>By Joule&#8217;s law of the mechanical equivalent of heat,
whenever heat is imparted to an elastic body, as air or
gas, energy is generated and mechanical work produced
by the expansion of the air or gas. When the heat is imparted
by combustion within a cylinder containing a movable
piston, the mechanical work becomes an amount
measurable by the observed pressure and movement of
the piston. The heat generated by the explosive elements
and the expansion of the non-combining elements of nitrogen
and water vapor that may have been injected into the
cylinder as moisture in the air, and the water vapor
formed by the union of the oxygen of the air with the
hydrogen of the gas, all add to the energy of the work
from their expansion by the heat of internal combustion.
As against this, the absorption of heat by the walls of the
cylinder, the piston, and cylinder-head or clearance walls,
becomes a modifying condition in the force imparted to
the moving piston.</p>

<p>It is found that when any explosive mixture of air and
gas or hydrocarbon vapor is fired, the pressure falls far
short of the pressure computed from the theoretical effect
of the heat produced, and from gauging the expansion of
the contents of a cylinder. It is now well known that in
practice the high efficiency which is promised by theoretical
calculation is never realized; but it must always be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
remembered that the heat of combustion is the real agent,
and that the gases and vapors are but the medium for the
conversion of inert elements of power into the activity of
energy by their chemical union. The theory of combustion
has been the leading stimulus to large expectations with
inventors and constructors of explosive motors; its entanglement
with the modifying elements in practice has
delayed the best development in construction, and as yet
no really positive design of best form or action seems to
have been accomplished, although great progress has been
made during the past decade in the development of speed,
reliability, economy, and power output of the individual
units of this comparatively new power.</p>

<p>One of the most serious difficulties in the practical development
of pressure, due to the theoretical computations
of the pressure value of the full heat, is probably caused
by imparting the heat of the fresh charge to the balance
of the previous charge that has been cooled by expansion
from the maximum pressure to near the atmospheric
pressure of the exhaust. The retardation in the velocity
of combustion of perfectly mixed elements is now well
known from experimental trials with measured quantities;
but the principal difficulty in applying these conditions
to the practical work of an explosive engine where a necessity
for a large clearance space cannot be obviated,
is in the inability to obtain a maximum effect from the
imperfect mixture and the mingling of the products of
the last explosion with the new mixture, which produces
a clouded condition that makes the ignition of the mass
irregular or chattering, as observed in the expansion lines
of indicator cards; but this must not be confounded with
the reaction of the spring in the indicator.</p>

<p>Stratification of the mixture has been claimed as taking
place in the clearance chamber of the cylinder; but this
is not a satisfactory explanation in view of the vortical
effect of the violent injection of the air and gas or vapor
mixture. It certainly cannot become a perfect mixture
in the time of a stroke of a high-speed motor of the two-cycle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
class. In a four-cycle engine, making 1,500 revolutions
per minute, the injection and compression in any
one cylinder take place in one twenty-fifth of a second&mdash;formerly
considered far too short a time for a perfect
infusion of the elements of combustion but now very easily
taken care of despite the extremely high speed of numerous
aviation and automobile power-plants.</p>

<p>In an examination of the times of explosion and the
corresponding pressures in both tables, it will be seen that
a mixture of 1 part gas to 6 parts air is the most effective
and will give the highest mean pressure in a gas-engine.
There is a limit to the relative proportions of illuminating
gas and air mixture that is explosive, somewhat variable,
depending upon the proportion of hydrogen in the gas.
With ordinary coal-gas, 1 of gas to 15 parts of air; and
on the lower end of the scale, 1 volume of gas to 2 parts
air, are non-explosive. With gasoline vapor the explosive
effect ceases at 1 to 16, and a saturated mixture of equal
volumes of vapor and air will not explode, while the most
intense explosive effect is from a mixture of 1 part vapor
to 9 parts air. In the use of gasoline and air mixtures
from a carburetor, the best effect is from 1 part saturated
air to 8 parts free air.</p>

<p>The weight of a cubic foot of gas and air mixture as
given in Col. 2 is found by adding the number of volumes
of air multiplied by its weight, .0807, to one volume of gas
of weight .035 pound per cubic foot and dividing by the
total number of volumes; for example, as in the table,
6 &times; .0807 = .<sup>5192</sup>&#8260;<sub>7</sub> = .074195 as in the first line, and so on
for any mixture or for other gases of different specific
weight per cubic foot. The heat units evolved by combustion
of the mixture (Col. 6) are obtained by dividing
the total heat units in a cubic foot of gas by the total
proportion of the mixture, <sup>660</sup>&#8260;<sub>7</sub> = 94.28 as in the first line
of the table. Col. 5 is obtained by multiplying the weight

of a pure mixture, as given in Col. 9.</p>

<p>The many recorded experiments made to solve the discrepancy
between the theoretical and the actual heat development
and resulting pressures in the cylinder of an
explosive motor, to which much discussion has been given
as to the possibilities of dissociation and the increased
specific heat of the elements of combustion and non-combustion,
as well, also, of absorption and radiation of heat,
have as yet furnished no satisfactory conclusion as to
what really takes place within the cylinder walls. There
seems to be very little known about dissociation, and
somewhat vague theories have been advanced to explain
the phenomenon. The fact is, nevertheless, apparent as
shown in the production of water and other producer
gases by the use of steam in contact with highly incandescent
fuel. It is known that a maximum explosive
mixture of pure gases, as hydrogen and oxygen or carbonic
oxide and oxygen, suffers a contraction of one-third
their volume by combustion to their compounds, steam or
carbonic acid. In the explosive mixtures in the cylinder
of a motor, however, the combining elements form so
small a proportion of the contents of the cylinder that
the shrinkage of their volume amounts to no more than
3 per cent. of the cylinder volume. This by no means
accounts for the great heat and pressure differences between
the theoretical and actual effects.</p>

<h3><a name="SecII_11" id="SecII_11"></a>CONVERSION OF HEAT TO POWER</h3>

<p>The utilization of heat in any heat-engine has long
been a theme of inquiry and experiment with scientists
and engineers, for the purpose of obtaining the best practical
conditions and construction of heat-engines that would
represent the highest efficiency or the nearest approach
to the theoretical value of heat, as measured by empirical
laws that have been derived from experimental researches
relating to its ultimate volume. It is well known that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
steam-engine returns only from 12 to 18 per cent. of the
power due to the heat generated by the fuel, about 25
per cent. of the total heat being lost in the chimney, the
only use of which is to create a draught for the fire; the
balance, some 60 per cent., is lost in the exhaust and by
radiation. The problem of utmost utilization of force
in steam has nearly reached its limit.</p>

<p>The internal-combustion system of creating power is
comparatively new in practice, and is but just settling
into definite shape by repeated trials and modification of
details, so as to give somewhat reliable data as to what
may be expected from the rival of the steam-engine as
a prime mover. For small powers, the gas, gasoline, and
petroleum-oil engines are forging ahead at a rapid rate,
filling the thousand wants of manufacture and business
for a power that does not require expensive care, that
is perfectly safe at all times, that can be used in any place
in the wide world to which its concentrated fuel can be
conveyed, and that has eliminated the constant handling
of crude fuel and water.</p>

<h3><a name="SecII_12" id="SecII_12"></a>REQUISITES FOR BEST POWER EFFECT</h3>

<p>The utilization of heat in a gas-engine is mainly due
to the manner in which the products entering into combustion
are distributed in relation to the movement of
the piston. The investigation of the foremost exponent
of the theory of the explosive motor was prophetic in
consideration of the later realization of the best conditions
under which these motors can be made to meet the
requirements of economy and practicability. As early as
1862, Beau de Rocha announced, in regard to the coming
power, that four requisites were the basis of operation
for economy and best effect. 1. The greatest possible
cylinder volume with the least possible cooling surface.
2. The greatest possible rapidity of expansion. Hence,
<i>high speed</i>. 3. The greatest possible expansion. <i>Long
stroke.</i> 4. The greatest possible pressure at the commencement
of expansion. <i>High compression</i>.</p>

<h3><a name="SecIII_1" id="SecIII_1"></a>EFFICIENCY OF INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES</h3>

<p>Efficiencies are worked out through intricate formulas
for a variety of theoretical and unknown conditions of
combustion in the cylinder: ratios of clearance and cylinder
volume, and the uncertain condition of the products
of combustion left from the last impulse and the wall
temperature. But they are of but little value, except as
a mathematical inquiry as to possibilities. The real commercial
efficiency of a gas or gasoline-engine depends upon
the volume of gas or liquid at some assigned cost, required
per actual brake horse-power per hour, in which
an indicator card should show that the mechanical action
of the valve gear and ignition was as perfect as practicable,
and that the ratio of clearance, space, and cylinder
volume gave a satisfactory terminal pressure and compression:
<i>i.e.</i>, the difference between the power figured
from the indicator card and the brake power being the
friction loss of the engine.</p>

<p>In four-cycle motors of the compression type, the efficiencies
are greatly advanced by compression, producing
a more complete infusion of the mixture of gas or vapor
and air, quicker firing, and far greater pressure than is
possible with the two-cycle type previously described. In
the practical operation of the gas-engine during the past
twenty years, the gas-consumption efficiencies per indicated
horse-power have gradually risen from 17 per cent.
to a maximum of 40 per cent. of the theoretical heat, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
this has been done chiefly through a decreased combustion
chamber and increased compression&mdash;the compression having
gradually increased in practice from 30 lbs. per square
inch to above 100; but there seems to be a limit to compression,
as the efficiency ratio decreases with greater increase
in compression. It has been shown that an ideal
efficiency of 33 per cent. for 38 lbs., compression will increase
to 40 per cent. for 66 lbs., and 43 per cent. for 88
lbs. compression. On the other hand, greater compression
means greater explosive pressure and greater strain on
the engine structure, which will probably retain in future
practice the compression between the limits of 40 and 90
lbs. except in super-compression engines intended for
high altitude work where compression pressures as high
as 125 pounds have been used.</p>

<p>In experiments made by Dugald Clerk, in England,
with a combustion chamber equal to 0.6 of the space swept
by the piston, with a compression of 38 lbs., the consumption
of gas was 24 cubic feet per indicated horse-power
per hour. With 0.4 compression space and 61 lbs. compression,
the consumption of gas was 20 cubic feet per
indicated horse-power per hour; and with 0.34 compression
space and 87 lbs. compression, the consumption of
gas fell to 14.8 cubic feet per indicated horse-power per
hour&mdash;the actual efficiencies being respectively 17, 21, and
25 per cent. This was with a Crossley four-cycle engine.</p>

<h3><a name="SecIII_2" id="SecIII_2"></a>VARIOUS MEASURES OF EFFICIENCY</h3>

<p>The efficiencies in regard to power in a heat-engine
may be divided into four kinds, as follows: I. The first
is known as the <i>maximum theoretical efficiency</i> of a perfect
engine (represented by the lines in the indicator diagram).
It is expressed by the formula</p>

<p>and shows
the work of a perfect cycle in an engine working between
the received temperature + absolute temperature (T<sub>1</sub>) and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
the initial atmospheric temperature + absolute temperature
(T<sub>0</sub>). II. The second is the <i>actual heat efficiency</i>,
or the ratio of the heat turned into work to the total heat
received by the engine. It expresses the <i>indicated horse-power</i>.
III. The third is the ratio between the second
or <i>actual heat efficiency</i> and the first or <i>maximum theoretical
efficiency</i> of a perfect cycle. It represents the
greatest possible utilization of the power of heat in an
internal-combustion engine. IV. The fourth is the <i>mechanical
efficiency</i>. This is the ratio between the actual
horse-power delivered by the engine through a dynamometer
or measured by a brake (brake horse-power),
and the indicated horse-power. The difference between
the two is the power lost by engine friction. In regard
to the general heat efficiency of the materials of power
in explosive engines, we find that with good illuminating
gas the practical efficiency varies from 25 to 40 per cent.;
kerosene-motors, 20 to 30; gasoline-motors, 20 to 32; acetylene,
25 to 35; alcohol, 20 to 30 per cent. of their heat
value. The great variation is no doubt due to imperfect
mixtures and variable conditions of the old and new charge
in the cylinder; uncertainty as to leakage and the perfection<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
of combustion. In the Diesel motors operating under
high pressure, up to nearly 500 pounds, an efficiency of
36 per cent. is claimed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="Fig012" id="Fig012"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 12.&mdash;Graphic Diagram Showing Approximate Utilization of Fuel
Burned in Internal-Combustion Engine.</p></div>

<p>The graphic diagram at <a href="#Fig012">Fig. 12</a> is of special value as
it shows clearly how the heat produced by charge combustion
is expended in an engine of average design.</p>

<p>On general principles the greater difference between
the heat of combustion and the heat at exhaust is the
relative measure of the heat turned into work, which
represents the degree of efficiency without loss during
expansion. The mathematical formulas appertaining to
the computation of the element of heat and its work in
an explosive engine are in a large measure dependent
upon assumed values, as the conditions of the heat of
combustion are made uncertain by the mixing of the fresh
charge with the products of a previous combustion, and
by absorption, radiation, and leakage. The computation
of the temperature from the observed pressure may be
made as before explained, but for compression-engines
the needed starting-points for computation are very uncertain,
and can only be approximated from the exact
measure and value of the elements of combustion in a
cylinder charge.</p>

<h3><a name="SecIII_3" id="SecIII_3"></a>TEMPERATURES AND PRESSURES</h3>

<p>Owing to the decrease from atmospheric pressure in
the indrawing charge of the cylinder, caused by valve and
frictional obstruction, the compression seldom starts above
13 lbs. absolute, especially in high-speed engines. Col. 3
in the following table represents the approximate absolute
compression pressure for the clearance percentage and
ratio in Cols. 1 and 2, while Col. 4 indicates the gauge
pressure from the atmospheric line. The temperatures in
Col. 5 are due to the compression in Col. 3 from an assumed
temperature of <span class="nowrap">560&deg;</span> F. in the mixture of the fresh
charge of 6 air to 1 gas with the products of combustion
left in the clearance chamber from the exhaust stroke of
a medium-speed motor. This temperature is subject to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
considerable variation from the difference in the heat-unit
power of the gases and vapors used for explosive
power, as also of the cylinder-cooling effect. In Col. 6 is
given the approximate temperatures of explosion for a
mixture of air 6 to gas 1 of 660 heat units per cubic foot,
for the relative values of the clearance ratio in Col. 2 at
constant volume.</p>

<h3><a name="SecIII_4" id="SecIII_4"></a>FACTORS GOVERNING ECONOMY</h3>

<p>In view of the experiments in this direction, it clearly
shows that in practical work, to obtain the greatest economy
per effective brake horse-power, it is necessary: 1st.
To transform the heat into work with the greatest rapidity
mechanically allowable. This means high piston speed.
2d. To have high initial compression. 3d. To reduce the
duration of contact between the hot gases and the cylinder
walls to the smallest amount possible; which means short
stroke and quick speed, with a spherical cylinder head.
4th. To adjust the temperature of the jacket water to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
obtain the most economical output of actual power. This
means water-tanks or water-coils, with air-cooling surfaces
suitable and adjustable to the most economical requirement
of the engine, which by late trials requires the jacket water
to be discharged at about <span class="nowrap">200&deg;</span> F. 5th. To reduce the
wall surface of the clearance space or combustion chamber
to the smallest possible area, in proportion to its required
volume. This lessens the loss of the heat of combustion by
exposure to a large surface, and allows of a higher mean
wall temperature to facilitate the heat of compression.</p>

<h3><a name="SecIII_5" id="SecIII_5"></a>LOSSES IN WALL COOLING</h3>

<p>In an experimental investigation of the efficiency of a
gas-engine under variable piston speeds made in France,
it was found that the useful effect increases with the velocity
of the piston&mdash;that is, with the rate of expansion
of the burning gases with mixtures of uniform volumes:
so that the variations of time of complete combustion
at constant pressure, and the variations due to speed, in
a way compensate in their efficiencies. The dilute mixture,
being slow burning, will have its time and pressure
quickened by increasing the speed.</p>

<p>Careful trials give unmistakable evidence that the useful
effect increases with the velocity of the piston&mdash;that
is, with the rate of expansion of the burning gases. The
time necessary for the explosion to become complete and
to attain its maximum pressure depends not only on the
composition of the mixture, but also upon the rate of expansion.
This has been verified in experiments with a
high-speed motor, at speeds from 500 to 2,000 revolutions
per minute, or piston speeds of from 16 to 64 feet per
second. The increased speed of combustion due to increased
piston speed is a matter of great importance to
builders of gas-engines, as well as to the users, as indicating
the mechanical direction of improvements to lessen
the wearing strain due to high speed and to lighten the
vibrating parts with increased strength, in order that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
balancing of high-speed engines may be accomplished with
the least weight.</p>

<p>From many experiments made in Europe and in the
United States, it has been conclusively proved that excessive
cylinder cooling by the water-jacket results in a
marked loss of efficiency. In a series of experiments with
a simplex engine in France, it was found that a saving
of 7 per cent. in gas consumption per brake horse-power
was made by raising the temperature of the jacket water
from <span class="nowrap">141&deg;</span> to <span class="nowrap">165&deg;</span> F. A still greater saving was made in
a trial with an Otto engine by raising the temperature of
the jacket water from <span class="nowrap">61&deg;</span> to <span class="nowrap">140&deg;</span> F.&mdash;it being 9.5 per
cent. less gas per brake horse-power.</p>

<p>It has been stated that volumes of similar cylinders
increase as the cube of their diameters, while the surface
of their cold walls varies as the square of their diameters;
so that for large cylinders the ratio of surface to volume
is less than for small ones. This points to greater economy
in the larger engines. The study of many experiments
goes to prove that combustion takes place gradually
in the gas-engine cylinder, and that the rate of increase
of pressure or rapidity of firing is controlled by dilution
and compression of the mixture, as well as by the rate
of expansion or piston speed. The rate of combustion
also depends on the size and shape of the explosion chamber,
and is increased by the mechanical agitation of the

of firing.</p>

<p>To the uninitiated, indicator cards are considerable
of a mystery; to those capable of reading them they form
an index relative to the action of any engine. An indicator
card, such as shown at <a href="#Fig013">Fig. 13</a>, is merely a graphical
representation of the various pressures existing in the
cylinder for different positions of the piston. The length
is to some scale that represents the stroke of the piston.
During the intake stroke, the pressure falls below the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
atmospheric line. During compression, the curve gradually
becomes higher owing to increasing pressure as the
volume is reduced. After ignition the pressure line moves
upward almost straight, then as the piston goes down on
the explosion stroke, the pressure falls gradually to the
point of exhaust valve, opening when the sudden release
of the imprisoned gas causes a reduction in pressure to
nearly atmospheric. An indicator card, or a series of
them, will always show by its lines the normal or defective
condition of the inlet valve and passages; the actual line
of compression; the firing moment; the pressure of explosion;
the velocity of combustion; the normal or defective
line of expansion, as measured by the adiabatic curve,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
and the normal or defective operation of the exhaust
valve, exhaust passages, and exhaust pipe. In fact, all
the cycles of an explosive motor may be made a practical
study from a close investigation of the lines of an indicator
card.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 14.&mdash;Diesel Motor Card.</p></div>

<p>A most unique card is that of the Diesel motor (<a href="#Fig014">Fig.
14</a>), which involves a distinct principle in the design and
operation of internal-combustion motors, in that instead
of taking a mixed charge for instantaneous explosion, its
charge primarily is of air and its compression to a pressure
at which a temperature is attained above the igniting
point of the fuel, then injecting the fuel under a still
higher pressure by which spontaneous combustion takes
place gradually with increasing volume over the compression
for part of the stroke or until the fuel charge is consumed.
The motor thus operating between the pressures
of 500 and 35 lbs. per square inch, with a clearance of
about 7 per cent., has given an efficiency of 36 per cent.
of the total heat value of kerosene oil.</p>

<h3><a name="SecIII_7" id="SecIII_7"></a>COMPRESSION IN EXPLOSIVE MOTORS</h3>

<p>That the compression in a gas, gasoline, or oil-engine
has a direct relation to the power obtained, has been long
known to experienced builders, having been suggested by
M. Beau de Rocha, in 1862, and afterward brought into
practical use in the four-cycle or Otto type about 1880.
The degree of compression has had a growth from zero,
in the early engines, to the highest available due to the
varying ignition temperatures of the different gases and
vapors used for explosive fuel, in order to avoid premature
explosion from the heat of compression. Much of
the increased power for equal-cylinder capacity is due to
compression of the charge from the fact that the most
powerful explosion of gases, or of any form of explosive
material, takes place when the particles are in the closest
contact or cohesion with one another, less energy in this
form being consumed by the ingredients themselves to
bring about their chemical combination, and consequently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
more energy is given out in useful or available work.
This is best shown by the ignition of gunpowder, which,
when ignited in the open air, burns rapidly, but without
explosion, an explosion only taking place if the powder
be confined or compressed into a small space.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="Fig015" id="Fig015"></a>
<img src="images/illo064.png" alt="Fig. 15" width="400" height="457" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 15.&mdash;Diagram of Heat in the Gas Engine Cylinder.</p></div>

<p>In a gas or gasoline-motor with a small clearance or
compression space&mdash;with high compression&mdash;the surface
with which the burning gases come into contact is much
smaller in comparison with the compression space in a
low-compression motor. Another advantage of a high-compression
motor is that on account of the smaller clearance
of combustion space less cooling water is required
than with a low-compression motor, as the temperature,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
and consequently the pressure, falls more rapidly. The
loss of heat through the water-jacket is thus less in the
case of a high-compression than in that of a low-compression
motor. In the non-compression type of motor the
best results were obtained with a charge of 16 to 18 parts
of gas and 100 parts of air, while in the compression type
the best results are obtained with an explosive mixture
of 7 to 10 parts of gas and 100 parts of air, thus showing
that by the utilization of compression a weaker charge
with a greater thermal efficiency is permissible.</p>

<p>It has been found that the explosive pressure resulting
from the ignition of the charge of gas or gasoline-vapor
and air in the gas-engine cylinder is about 4<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> times the
pressure prior to ignition. The difficulty about getting
high compression is that if the pressure is too high the
charge is likely to ignite prematurely, as compression
always results in increased temperature. The cylinder
may become too hot, a deposit of carbon, a projecting
electrode or plug body in the cylinder may become incandescent
and ignite the charge which has been excessively
heated by the high compression and mixture of
the hot gases of the previous explosion.</p>

<h3><a name="SecIII_8" id="SecIII_8"></a>FACTORS LIMITING COMPRESSION</h3>

<p>With gasoline-vapor and air the compression should not
be raised above about 90 to 95 pounds to the square inch,
many manufacturers not going above 65 or 70 pounds.
For natural gas the compression pressure may easily be
raised to from 85 to 100 pounds per square inch. For
gases of low calorific value, such as blast-furnace or producer-gas,
the compression may be increased to from 140
to 190 pounds. In fact the ability to raise the compression
to a high point with these gases is one of the principal
reasons for their successful adoption for gas-engine
use. In kerosene injection engines the compression of 250
pounds per square inch has been used with marked economy.
Many troubles in regard to loss of power and increase
of fuel have occurred and will no doubt continue,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
owing to the wear of valves, piston, and cylinder, which
produces a loss in compression and explosive pressure
and a waste of fuel by leakage. Faulty adjustment of
valve movement is also a cause of loss of power; which
may be from tardy closing of the inlet-valve or a too early
opening of the exhaust-valve.</p>

<p>The explosive pressure varies to a considerable amount
in proportion to the compression pressure by the difference
in fuel value and the proportions of air mixtures,
so that for good illuminating gas the explosive pressure
may be from 2.5 to 4 times the compression pressure.
For natural gas 3 to 4.5, for gasoline 3 to 5, for producer-gas
2 to 3, and for kerosene by injection 3 to 6.</p>

<p>The compression temperatures, although well known
and easily computed from a known normal temperature
of the explosive mixture, are subject to the effect of the
uncertain temperature of the gases of the previous explosion
remaining in the cylinder, the temperature of its
walls, and the relative volume of the charge, whether full
or scant; which are terms too variable to make any computations
reliable or available.</p>

<p>For the theoretical compression temperatures from a
known normal temperature, we append a table of the rise
in temperature for the compression pressures in the following

<h3>CHART FOR DETERMINING COMPRESSION PRESSURES</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="Fig016" id="Fig016"></a>
<img src="images/illo067.png" alt="Fig. 16" width="500" height="402" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 16.&mdash;Chart Showing Relation Between Compression Volume
and Pressure.</p></div>

<p>A very useful chart (<a href="#Fig016">Fig. 16</a>) for determining compression
pressures in gasoline-engine cylinders for various
ratios of compression space to total cylinder volume
is given by P. S. Tice, and described in the Chilton Automobile
Directory by the originator as follows:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>It is many times desirable to have at hand a convenient
means for at once determining with accuracy what
the compression pressure will be in a gasoline-engine cylinder,
the relationship between the volume of the compression
space and the total cylinder volume or that swept
by the piston being known. The curve at <a href="#Fig016">Fig. 16</a> is
offered as such a means. It is based on empirical data
gathered from upward of two dozen modern automobile
engines and represents what may be taken to be the results
as found in practice. It is usual for the designer to find
compression pressure values, knowing the volumes from
the equation</p>

<table class="formula" summary="formula p 72">

<tr>
<td rowspan="2" class="left">P<sub>2</sub> = P<sub>1</sub> <span class="fsize150">(</span></td>

<p>which is for adiabatic compression of air. Equation (1)
is right enough in general form but gives results which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
are entirely too high, as almost all designers know from
experience. The trouble lies in the interchange of heat
between the compressed gases and the cylinder walls, in
the diminution of the exponent (1.4 in the above) due to the
lesser ratio of specific heat of gasoline vapor and in the
transfer of heat from the gases which are being compressed
to whatever fuel may enter the cylinder in an
unvaporized condition. Also, there is always some piston
leakage, and, if the form of the equation (1) is to be
retained, this also tends to lower the value of the exponent.
From experience with many engines, it appears
that compression reaches its highest value in the cylinder
for but a short range of motor speeds, usually during the
mid-range. Also, it appears that, at those speeds at which
compression shows its highest values, the initial pressure
at the start of the compression stroke is from .5 to .9 lb.
below atmospheric. Taking this latter loss value, which
shows more often than those of lesser value, the compression
is seen to start from an initial pressure of 13.9 lbs.
per sq. in. absolute.</p>

<p>Also, experiment shows that if the exponent be given
the value 1.26, instead of 1.4, the equation will embrace
all heat losses in the compressed gas, and compensate for
the changed ratio of specific heats for the mixture and
also for all piston leakage, in the average engine with
rings in good condition and tight. In the light of the
foregoing, and in view of results obtained from its use,
the above curve is offered&mdash;values of P<sub>2</sub> being found
from the equation</p>

<table class="formula" summary="formula p 73">

<p>In using this curve it must be remembered that pressures
are absolute. Thus: suppose it is desired to know
the volumetric relationships of the cylinder for a compression
pressure of 75 lbs. gauge. Add atmospheric
pressure to the desired gauge pressure 14.7 + 75 = 89.7
lbs. absolute. Locate this pressure on the scale of ordinates<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
and follow horizontally across to the curve and then
vertically downward to the scale of abscissas, where the
ratio of the combustion chamber volume to the total cylinder
volume is given, which latter is equal to the sum of
the combustion chamber volume and that of the piston
sweep. In the above case it is found that the combustion
space for a compression pressure of 75 lbs. gauge will be
.225 of the total cylinder volume, or .225 &divide; .775 = .2905
of the piston sweep volume. Conversely, knowing the
volumetric ratios, compression pressure can be read directly
by proceeding from the scale of abscissas vertically
to the curve and thence horizontally to the scale of
ordinates.</p>

<h3><a name="SecIII_9" id="SecIII_9"></a>CAUSES OF HEAT LOSS AND INEFFICIENCY IN EXPLOSIVE MOTORS</h3>

<p>The difference realized in the practical operation of
an internal combustion heat engine from the computed
effect derived from the values of the explosive elements
is probably the most serious difficulty that engineers have
encountered in their endeavors to arrive at a rational
conclusion as to where the losses were located, and the
ways and means of design that would eliminate the causes
of loss and raise the efficiency step by step to a reasonable
percentage of the total efficiency of a perfect cycle.</p>

<p>An authority on the relative condition of the chemical
elements under combustion in closed cylinders attributes
the variation of temperature shown in the fall of the expansion
curve, and the suppression or retarded evolution
of heat, entirely to the cooling action of the cylinder walls,
and to this nearly all the phenomena hitherto obscure in
the cylinder of a gas-engine. Others attribute the great
difference between the theoretical temperature of combustion
and the actual temperature realized in the practical
operation of the gas-engine, a loss of more than one-half
of the total heat energy of the combustibles, partly to the
dissociation of the elements of combustion at extremely
high temperatures and their reassociation by expansion
in the cylinder, to account for the supposed continued<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
combustion and extra adiabatic curve of the expansion
line on the indicator card.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="Fig017" id="Fig017"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 17.&mdash;The Thompson Indicator, an Instrument for Determining Compressions
and Explosion Pressure Values and Recording Them on Chart.</p></div>

<p>The loss of heat to the walls of the cylinder, piston,
and clearance space, as regards the proportion of wall
surface to the volume, has gradually brought this point
to its smallest ratio in the concave piston-head and globular
cylinder-head, with the smallest possible space in the
inlet and exhaust passage. The wall surface of a cylindrical
clearance space or combustion chamber of one-half
its unit diameter in length is equal to 3.1416 square units,
its volume but 0.3927 of a cubic unit; while the same wall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
surface in a spherical form has a volume of 0.5236 of a
cubic unit. It will be readily seen that the volume is increased
33<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>3</sub> per cent. in a spherical over a cylindrical
form for equal wall surfaces at the moment of explosion,
when it is desirable that the greatest amount of heat is
generated, and carrying with it the greatest possible pressure
from which the expansion takes place by the movement
of the piston.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 19.&mdash;Enlarged Combustion

<p>The spherical form cannot continue during the stroke
for mechanical reasons; therefore some proportion of
piston stroke of cylinder volume must be found to correspond
with a spherical form of the combustion chamber
to produce the least loss of heat through the walls during
the combustion and expansion part of the stroke. This
idea is illustrated in <a href="#Fig018">Figs. 18</a> and <a href="#Fig019">19</a>, showing how the
relative volumes of cylinder stroke and combustion chamber
may be varied to suit the requirements due to the
quality of the elements of combustion.</p>

<p>Although the concave piston-head shows economy in
regard to the relation of the clearance volume to the wall
area at the moment of explosive combustion, it may be
clearly seen that its concavity increases its surface area
and its capacity for absorbing heat, for which there is
no provision for cooling the piston, save its contact with
the walls of the cylinder and the slight air cooling of its
back by its reciprocal motion. For this reason the concave
piston-head has not been generally adopted and the
concave cylinder-head, as shown in <a href="#Fig019">Fig. 19</a>, with a flat<span class='pagenum'><a

<h3><a name="SecIII_10" id="SecIII_10"></a>HEAT LOSSES TO COOLING WATER</h3>

<p>The mean temperature of the wall surface of the combustion
chamber and cylinder, as indicated by the temperatures
of the circulating water, has been found to be
an important item in the economy of the gas-engine.
Dugald Clerk, in England, a high authority in practical
work with the gas-engine, found that 10 per cent. of the
gas for a stated amount of power was saved by using
water at a temperature in which the ejected water from
the cylinder-jacket was near the boiling-point, and ventures
the opinion that a still higher temperature for the
circulating water may be used as a source of economy.
This could be made practical in the case of aviation engines
by adjusting the air-cooling surface of the radiator
so as to maintain the inlet water at just below the boiling
point, and by the rapid circulation induced by the pump
pressure, to return the water from the cylinder-jacket a
few degrees above the boiling point. The thermal displacement
systems of cooling employed in automobiles
are working under more favorable temperature conditions
than those engines in which cooling is more energetic.</p>

<p>For a given amount of heat taken from the cylinder
by the largest volume of circulating water, the difference
in temperature between inlet and outlet of the water-jacket
should be the least possible, and this condition of
the water circulation gives a more even temperature to
all parts of the cylinder; while, on the contrary, a cold-water
supply, say at <span class="nowrap">60&deg;</span> F., so slow as to allow the ejected
water to flow off at a temperature near the boiling-point,
must make a great difference in temperature between the
bottom and top of the cylinder, with a loss in economy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
in gas and other fuels, as well as in water, if it is obtained
by measurement.</p>

<p>From the foregoing considerations of losses and inefficiencies,
we find that the practice in motor design and
construction has not yet reached the desired perfection
in its cycular operation. Step by step improvements have
been made with many changes in design though many
have been without merit as an improvement, farther than
to gratify the longings of designers for something different
from the other thing, and to establish a special
construction of their own. These efforts may in time
produce a motor of normal or standard design for each
kind of fuel that will give the highest possible efficiency
for all conditions of service.</p>

<h3><a name="SecIV_1" id="SecIV_1"></a>ENGINE PARTS AND FUNCTIONS</h3>

<p>The principal elements of a gas engine are not difficult
to understand and their functions are easily defined.
In place of the barrel of the gun one has a smoothly
machined cylinder in which a small cylindrical or barrel-shaped
element fitting the bore closely may be likened to
a bullet or cannon ball. It differs in this important
respect, however, as while the shot is discharged from
the mouth of the cannon the piston member sliding inside
of the main cylinder cannot leave it, as its movements
back and forth from the open to the closed end and back
again are limited by simple mechanical connection or linkage
which comprises crank and connection rod. It is by
this means that the reciprocating movement of the piston
is transformed into a rotary motion of the crank-shaft.</p>

<p>The fly-wheel is a heavy member attached to the crank-shaft
of an automobile engine which has energy stored
in its rim as the member revolves, and the momentum
of this revolving mass tends to equalize the intermittent
pushes on the piston head produced by the explosion of
the gas in the cylinder. In aviation engines, the weight
of the propeller or that of rotating cylinders themselves
performs the duty of a fly-wheel, so no separate member
is needed. If some explosive is placed in the chamber
formed by the piston and closed end of the cylinder and
exploded, the piston would be the only part that would
yield to the pressure which would produce a downward
movement. As this is forced down the crank-shaft is<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a></span>
turned by the connecting rod, and as this part is hinged
at both ends it is free to oscillate as the crank turns, and
thus the piston may slide back and forth while the crank-shaft
is rotating or describing a curvilinear path.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;"><a name="Fig021" id="Fig021"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 21.&mdash;Side Sectional View of Typical Airplane Engine, Showing Parts and Their Relation to Each Other.
This Engine is an Aeromarine Design and Utilizes a Distinctive Concentric Valve Construction.</p></div>

<p>In addition to the simple elements described it is evident
that a gasoline engine must have other parts. The
most important of these are the valves, of which there are
generally two to each cylinder. One closes the passage
connecting to the gas supply and opens during one stroke
of the piston in order to let the explosive gas into the
combustion chamber. The other member, or exhaust
valve, serves as a cover for the opening through which
the burned gases can leave the cylinder after their work
is done. The spark plug is a simple device which may
be compared to the fuse or percussion cap of the cannon.
It permits one to produce an electric spark in the cylinder
when the piston is at the best point to utilize the
pressure which obtains when the compressed gas is fired.
The valves are open one at a time, the inlet valve being
lifted from its seat while the cylinder is filling and the
exhaust valve is opened when the cylinder is being cleared.
They are normally kept seated by means of compression
springs. In the simple motor shown at <a href="#Fig005">Fig. 5</a>, the exhaust
valve is operated by means of a pivoted bell crank rocked
by a cam which turns at half the speed of the crank-shaft.
The inlet valve operates automatically, as will be explained
in proper sequence.</p>

<p>In order to obtain a perfectly tight combustion chamber,
both intake and exhaust valves are closed before the
gas is ignited, because all of the pressure produced by
the exploding gas is to be directed against the top of
the movable piston. When the piston reaches the bottom
of its power stroke, the exhaust valve is lifted by means
of the bell crank which is rocked because of the point or
lift on the cam. The cam-shaft is driven by positive
gearing and revolves at half the engine speed. The exhaust
valve remains open during the whole of the return
stroke of the piston, and as this member moves toward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the closed end of the cylinder it forces out burned gases
ahead of it, through the passage controlled by the exhaust
valve. The cam-shaft is revolved at half the engine speed
because the exhaust valve is raised from its seat during
only one stroke out of four, or only once every two revolutions.
Obviously, if the cam was turned at the same
speed as the crank-shaft it would remain open once every
revolution, whereas the burned gases are expelled from
the individual cylinders only once in two turns of the
crank-shaft.</p>

<h3><a name="SecIV_2" id="SecIV_2"></a>WHY MULTIPLE CYLINDER FORMS ARE BEST</h3>

<p>Owing to the vibration which obtains from the heavy
explosion in the large single-cylinder engines used for
stationary power other forms were evolved in which the
cylinder was smaller and power obtained by running the
engine faster, but these are suitable only for very low
powers.</p>

<p>When a single-cylinder engine is employed a very
heavy fly-wheel is needed to carry the moving parts
through idle strokes necessary to obtain a power impulse.
For this reason automobile and aircraft designers
must use more than one cylinder, and the tendency
is to produce power by frequently occurring light impulses
rather than by a smaller number of explosions
having greater force. When a single-cylinder motor is
employed the construction is heavier than is needed with
a multiple-cylinder form. Using two or more cylinders
conduces to steady power generation and a lessening of
vibration. Most modern motor cars employ four-cylinder
engines because a power impulse may be secured twice
every revolution of the crank-shaft, or a total of four power
strokes during two revolutions. The parts are so
arranged that while the charge of gas in one cylinder is
exploding, those which come next in firing order are compressing,
discharging the inert gases and drawing in a
fresh charge respectively. When the power stroke is
completed in one cylinder, the piston in that member in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
which a charge of gas has just been compressed has
reached the top of its stroke and when the gas is exploded
the piston is reciprocated and keeps the crank-shaft
turning. When a multiple-cylinder engine is used
the fly-wheel can be made much lighter than that of the
simpler form and eliminated altogether in some designs.
In fact, many modern multiple-cylinder engines developing
300 horse-power weigh less than the early single- and
double-cylinder forms which developed but one-tenth or
one-twentieth that amount of energy.</p>

<h3><a name="SecIV_3" id="SecIV_3"></a><a name="SecIV_4" id="SecIV_4"></a>DESCRIBING SEQUENCE OF OPERATIONS</h3>

<p>Referring to <a href="#Fig022">Fig. 22</a>, A, the sequence of operation in
a single-cylinder motor can be easily understood. Assuming
that the crank-shaft is turning in the direction
of the arrow, it will be seen that the intake stroke comes
first, then the compression, which is followed by the power
impulse, and lastly the exhaust stroke. If two cylinders
are used, it is possible to balance the explosions in such
a way that one will occur each revolution. This is true
with either one of two forms of four-cycle motors. At
B, a two-cylinder vertical engine using a crank-shaft in
which the crank-pins are on the same plane is shown.
The two pistons move up and down simultaneously. Referring
to the diagram describing the strokes, and assuming
that the outer circle represents the cycle of operations
in one cylinder while the inner circle represents the sequence
of events in the other cylinder, while cylinder
No. 1 is taking in a fresh charge of gas, cylinder No. 2
is exploding. When cylinder No. 1 is compressing, cylinder
No. 2 is exhausting. During the time that the charge
in cylinder No. 1 is exploded, cylinder No. 2 is being filled
with fresh gas. While the exhaust gases are being discharged
from cylinder No. 1, cylinder No. 2 is compressing
the gas previously taken.</p>

<p>The same condition obtains when the crank-pins are
arranged at one hundred and eighty degrees and the cylinders
are opposed, as shown at C. The reason that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
two-cylinder opposed motor is more popular than that
having two vertical cylinders is that it is difficult to balance
the construction shown at B, so that the vibration
will not be excessive. The two-cylinder opposed motor
has much less vibration than the other form, and as the
explosions occur evenly and the motor is a simple one
to construct, it has been very popular in the past on
light cars and has received limited application on some
early, light airplanes.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 23.&mdash;Diagrams Demonstrating Clearly Advantages which Obtain when
Multiple-Cylinder Motors are Used as Power Plants.</p></div>

<p>To demonstrate very clearly the advantages of multiple-cylinder
engines the diagrams at <a href="#Fig023">Fig. 23</a> have been
prepared. At A, a three-cylinder motor, having crank-pins
at one hundred and twenty degrees, which means that
they are spaced at thirds of the circle, we have a form
of construction that gives a more even turning than that
possible with a two-cylinder engine. Instead of one explosion
per revolution of the crank-shaft, one will obtain
three explosions in two revolutions. The manner in which
the explosion strokes occur and the manner they overlap
strokes in the other cylinder is shown at A. Assuming
that the cylinders fire in the following order, first No. 1,
then No. 2, and last No. 3, we will see that while cylinder
No. 1, represented by the outer circle, is on the power
stroke, cylinder No. 3 has completed the last two-thirds
of its exhaust stroke and has started on its intake stroke.
Cylinder No. 2, represented by the middle circle, during
this same period has completed its intake stroke and two-thirds
of its compression stroke. A study of the diagram
will show that there is an appreciable lapse of time between
each explosion.</p>

<p>Three-cylinder engines are not used on aircraft at the
present time, though Bleriot&#8217;s flight across the British
Channel was made with a three-cylinder Anzani motor.
It was not a conventional form, however. The three-cylinder
engine is practically obsolete at this time for any
purpose except &#8220;penguins&#8221; or school machines that are
incapable of flight and which are used in some French
training schools for aviators.</p>

<h3><a name="SecIV_5" id="SecIV_5"></a>FOUR- AND SIX-CYLINDER ENGINES</h3>

<p>In the four-cylinder engine operation which is shown
at <a href="#Fig023">Fig. 23</a>, B, it will be seen that the power strokes follow
each other without loss of time, and one cylinder begins
to fire and the piston moves down just as soon as the
member ahead of it has completed its power stroke. In
a four-cylinder motor, the crank-pins are placed at one
hundred and eighty degrees, or on the halves of the crank
circle. The crank-pins for cylinders No. 1 and No. 4 are
on the same plane, while those for cylinders No. 2 and
No. 3 also move in unison. The diagram describing sequence
of operations in each cylinder is based on a firing
order of one, two, four, three. The outer circle, as in
previous instances, represents the cycle of operations in
cylinder one. The next one toward the center, cylinder
No. 2, the third circle represents the sequence of events
in cylinder No. 3, while the inner circle outlines the strokes
in cylinder four. The various cylinders are working as
follows:</p>

</table>

<p>It will be obvious that regardless of the method of
construction, or the number of cylinders employed, exactly
the same number of parts must be used in each
cylinder assembly and one can conveniently compare
any multiple-cylinder power plant as a series of single-cylinder
engines joined one behind the other and so
coupled that one will deliver power and produce useful
energy at the crank-shaft where the other leaves off.
The same fundamental laws governing the action of a
single cylinder obtain when a number are employed, and
the sequence of operation is the same in all members, except
that the necessary functions take place at different<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
times. If, for instance, all the cylinders of a four-cylinder
motor were fired at the same time, one would obtain
the same effect as though a one-piston engine was used,
which had a piston displacement equal to that of the four
smaller members. As is the case with a single-cylinder
engine, the motor would be out of correct mechanical balance
because all the connecting rods would be placed on
crank-pins that lie in the same plane. A very large fly-wheel
would be necessary to carry the piston through the
idle strokes, and large balance weights would be fitted to
the crank-shaft in an effort to compensate for the weight
of the four pistons, and thus reduce vibratory stresses
which obtain when parts are not in correct balance.</p>

<p>There would be no advantage gained by using four
cylinders in this manner, and there would be more loss of
heat and more power consumed in friction than in a one-piston
motor of the same capacity. This is the reason
that when four cylinders are used the arrangement of
crank-pins is always as shown at <a href="#Fig023">Fig. 23</a>, B&mdash;i.e., two
pistons are up, while the other two are at the bottom of
the stroke. With this construction, we have seen that it
is possible to string out the explosions so that there will
always be one cylinder applying power to the crank-shaft.
The explosions are spaced equally. The parts are in
correct mechanical balance because two pistons are on the
upstroke while the other two are descending. Care is
taken to have one set of moving members weigh exactly
the same as the other. With a four-cylinder engine one
has correct balance and continuous application of energy.
This insures a smoother running motor which has greater
efficiency than the simpler one-, two-, and three-cylinder
forms previously described. Eliminating the stresses
which would obtain if we had an unbalanced mechanism
and irregular power application makes for longer life.
Obviously a large number of relatively light explosions
will produce less wear and strain than would a lesser
number of powerful ones. As the parts can be built lighter
if the explosions are not heavy, the engine can be operated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
at higher rotative speeds than when large and cumbersome
members are utilized. Four-cylinder engines
intended for aviation work have been built according to
the designs shown at <a href="#Fig024">Fig. 24</a>, but these forms are unconventional
and seldom if ever used.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 24.&mdash;Showing Three Possible Though Unconventional Arrangements of

<p>The six-cylinder type of motor, the action of which is
shown at <a href="#Fig023">Fig. 23</a>, C, is superior to the four-cylinder, inasmuch
as the power strokes overlap, and instead of having
two explosions each revolution we have three explosions.
The conventional crank-shaft arrangement in a six-cylinder
engine is just the same as though one used two three-cylinder
shafts fastened together, so pistons 1 and 6 are
on the same plane as are pistons 2 and 5. Pistons 3 and
4 also travel together. With the cranks arranged as outlined
at <a href="#Fig023">Fig. 23</a>, C, the firing order is one, five, three, six,
two, four. The manner in which the power strokes overlap
is clearly shown in the diagram. An interesting comparison<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
is also made in the diagrams at <a href="#Fig025">Fig. 25</a> and in the
upper corner of <a href="#Fig023">Fig. 23</a>, C.</p>

<p>A rectangle is divided into four columns; each of these
corresponds to one hundred and eighty degrees, or half a
revolution. Thus the first revolution of the crank-shaft
is represented by the first two columns, while the second
revolution is represented by the last two. Taking the portion
of the diagram which shows the power impulse in a
one-cylinder engine, we see that during the first revolution
there has been no power impulse. During the first half
of the second revolution, however, an explosion takes place
and a power impulse is obtained. The last portion of the
second revolution is devoted to exhausting the burned
gases, so that there are three idle strokes and but one
power stroke. The effect when two cylinders are employed
is shown immediately below.</p>

a four-cylinder engine there is an explosion each half revolution,
while in a six-cylinder engine there is one and one-half
explosions during each half revolution. When six
cylinders are used there is no lapse of time between power
impulses, as these overlap and a continuous and smooth-turning
movement is imparted to the crank shaft. The
diagram shown at <a href="#Fig026">Fig. 26</a>, prepared by E. P. Pulley, can
be studied to advantage in securing an idea of the coordination
of effort that takes place in an engine of the six-cylinder

<h3>ACTUAL DURATION OF DIFFERENT STROKES</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="Fig027" id="Fig027"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 27.&mdash;Diagram Showing Actual Duration of Different Strokes in Degrees.</p></div>

<p>In the diagrams previously presented the writer has
assumed, for the sake of simplicity, that each stroke takes
place during half of one revolution of the crank-shaft,
which corresponds to a crank-pin travel of one hundred
and eighty degrees. The actual duration of these strokes
is somewhat different. For example, the inlet stroke is
usually a trifle more than a half revolution, and the exhaust
is always considerably more. The diagram showing the
comparative duration of the strokes is shown at <a href="#Fig027">Fig.
27</a>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
The inlet valve opens ten degrees after the piston starts
to go down and remains open thirty degrees after the
piston has reached the bottom of its stroke. This means
that the suction stroke corresponds to a crank-pin travel
of two hundred degrees, while the compression stroke is
measured by a movement of but one hundred and fifty
degrees. It is common practice to open the exhaust valve
before the piston reaches the end of the power stroke so
that the actual duration of the power stroke is about one
hundred and forty degrees, while the exhaust stroke corresponds
to a crank-pin travel of two hundred and twenty-five
degrees. In this diagram, which represents proper
time for the valves to open and close, the dimensions in
inches given are measured on the fly-wheel and apply only
to a certain automobile motor. If the fly-wheel were
smaller ten degrees would take up less than the dimensions
given, while if the fly-wheel was larger a greater space on
its circumference would represent the same crank-pin
travel. Aviation engines are timed by using a timing disc
attached to the crank-shaft as they are not provided with
fly-wheels. Obviously, the distance measured in inches
will depend upon the diameter of the disc, though the
number of degrees interval would not change.</p>

<p>Those who have followed the development of the gasoline
engine will recall the arguments that were made when
the six-cylinder motor was introduced at a time that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
four-cylinder type was considered standard. The arrival
of the eight-cylinder has created similar futile discussion
of its practicability as this is so clearly established as to
be accepted without question. It has been a standard
power plant for aeroplanes for many years, early exponents
having been the Antoinette, the Woolsley, the
Renault, the E. N. V. in Europe and the Curtiss in the
United States.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 29.&mdash;Types of Eight-Cylinder Engines Showing the Advantage of the
V Method of Cylinder Placing.</p></div>

<p>The reason the V type shown at <a href="#Fig029">Fig. 29</a>, A is favored is
that the &#8220;all-in-line form&#8221; which is shown at <a href="#Fig029">Fig. 29</a>, B is
not practical for aircraft because of its length. Compared
to the standard four-cylinder engine it is nearly twice as
long and it required a much stronger and longer crank-shaft.
It will be evident that it could not be located to
advantage in the airplane fuselage. These undesirable
factors are eliminated in the V type eight-cylinder motor,
as it consists of two blocks of four cylinders each, so arranged
that one set or block is at an angle of forty-five
degrees from the vertical center line of the motor, or at
an angle of ninety degrees with the other set. This
arrangement of cylinders produces a motor that is no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
longer than a four-cylinder engine of half the power
would be.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 30.&mdash;Curves Showing Torque of Various Engine Types Demonstrate
Graphically Marked Advantage of the Eight-Cylinder Type.</p></div>

<p>Apparently there is considerable misconception as to
the advantage of the two extra cylinders of the eight as
compared with the six-cylinder. It should be borne in mind
that the multiplication in the number of cylinders noticed
since the early days of automobile development has not
been for solely increasing the power of the engine, but to
secure a more even turning movement, greater flexibility
and to eliminate destructive vibration. The ideal internal
combustion motor, is the one having the most uniform turning
movement with the least mechanical friction loss.
Study of the torque outlines or plotted graphics shown
at <a href="#Fig025">Figs. 25</a> and <a href="#Fig030">30</a> will show how multiplication of cylinders
will produce steady power delivery due to overlapping
impulses. The most practical form would be that which
more nearly conforms to the steady running produced by
a steam turbine or electric motor. The advocates of the
eight-cylinder engine bring up the item of uniform torque<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
as one of the most important advantages of the eight-cylinder
design. A number of torque diagrams are shown
at <a href="#Fig030">Fig. 30</a>. While these appear to be deeply technical,
they may be very easily followed when their purpose is
explained. At the top is shown the torque diagram of a
single-cylinder motor of the four-cycle type. The high
point in the line represents the period of greatest torque
or power generation, and it will be evident that this occurs
early in the first revolution of the crank-shaft. Below this
diagram is shown a similar curve except that it is produced
by a four-cylinder engine. Inspection will show that
the turning-moment is much more uniform than in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
single cylinder; similarly, the six-cylinder diagram is an
improvement over the four, and the eight-cylinder diagram
is an improvement over the six-cylinder.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 32.&mdash;How the Angle Between the Cylinders of an Eight- and Twelve-Cylinder V Motor Varies.</p></div>

<p>The reason that practically continuous torque is obtained
in an eight-cylinder engine is that one cylinder fires
every ninety degrees of crank-shaft rotation, and as each
impulse lasts nearly seventy-five per cent. of the stroke,
one can easily appreciate that an engine that will give four
explosions per revolution of the crank-shaft will run more
uniformly than one that gives but three explosions per
revolution, as the six-cylinder does, and will be twice as
smooth running as a four-cylinder, in which but two explosions
occur per revolution of the crank-shaft. The comparison
is so clearly shown in graphical diagrams and in
<a href="#Fig031">Fig. 31</a> that further description is unnecessary.</p>

<p>Any eight-cylinder engine may be considered a &#8220;twin-four,&#8221;
twelve-cylinder engines may be considered &#8220;twin
sixes.&#8221;</p>

Aviation Motor.</p></div>

<p>The only points in which an eight-cylinder motor differs
from a four-cylinder is in the arrangement of the
connecting rod, as in many designs it is necessary to have
two rods working from the same crank-pin. This difficulty
is easily overcome in some designs by staggering the cylinders
and having the two connecting rod big ends of conventional
form side by side on a common crank-pin. In
other designs one rod is a forked form and works on the
outside of a rod of the regular pattern. Still another
method is to have a boss just above the main bearing on
one connecting rod to which the lower portion of the connecting
rod in the opposite cylinder is hinged. As the
eight-cylinder engine may actually be made lighter than
the six-cylinder of equal power, it is possible to use smaller
reciprocating parts, such as pistons, connecting rods and
valve gear, and obtain higher engine speed with practically
no vibration. The firing order in nearly every case is the
same as in a four-cylinder except that the explosions occur
alternately in each set of cylinders. The firing order of
an eight-cylinder motor is apt to be confusing to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100"
id="Page_100">[100]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a></span>
motorist, especially if one considers that there are eight
possible sequences. The majority of engineers favor the
alternate firing from side to side. Firing orders will be
considered in proper sequence.</p>

<p>The demand of aircraft designers for more power has
stimulated designers to work out twelve-cylinder motors.
These are high-speed motors incorporating all recent features
of design in securing light reciprocating parts, large
valve openings, etc. The twelve-cylinder motor incorporates
the best features of high-speed motor design and there
is no need at this time to discuss further the pros and cons
of the twelve-cylinder versus the eight or six, because it
is conceded by all that there is the same degree of steady
power application in the twelve over the eight as there
would be in the eight over the six. The question resolves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
itself into having a motor of high power that will run with
minimum vibration and that produces smooth action. This
is well shown by diagrams at <a href="#Fig031">Fig. 31</a>. It should be remembered
that if an eight-cylinder engine will give four
explosions per revolution of the fly-wheel, a twelve-cylinder
type will give six explosions per revolution, and instead
of the impulses coming 90 degrees crank travel apart, as
in the case of the eight-cylinder, these will come but 60
degrees of crank travel apart in the case of the twelve-cylinder.
For this reason, the cylinders of a twelve are
usually separated by 60 degrees while the eight has the
blocks spaced 90 degrees apart. The comparison can be
easily made by comparing the sectional views of Vee
engines at <a href="#Fig032">Fig. 32</a>. When one realizes that the actual
duration of the power stroke is considerably greater than
120 degrees crank travel, it will be apparent that the
overlapping of explosions must deliver a very uniform
application of power. Vee engines have been devised<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
having the cylinders spaced but 45 degrees apart, but the
explosions cannot be timed at equal intervals as when 90
degrees separate the cylinder center lines.</p>

<h3><a name="SecIV_7" id="SecIV_7"></a>RADIAL CYLINDER ARRANGEMENTS</h3>

<p>While the fixed cylinder forms of engines, having the
cylinders in tandem in the four- and six-cylinder models
as shown at <a href="#Fig033">Figs. 33</a> to <a href="#Fig035">35</a> inclusive and the eight-cylinder
V types as outlined at <a href="#Fig036">Figs. 36</a> and <a href="#Fig037">37</a> have been generally
used and are most in favor at the present time, other forms
of motors having unconventional cylinder arrangements
have been devised, though most of these are practically<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
obsolete. While many methods of decreasing weight and
increasing mechanical efficiency of a motor are known to
designers, one of the first to be applied to the construction
of aeronautical power plants was an endeavor to group
the components, which in themselves were not extremely
light, into a form that would be considerably lighter than
the conventional design. As an example, we may consider
those multiple-cylinder forms in which the cylinders are
disposed around a short crank-case, either radiating from
a common center as at <a href="#Fig038">Fig. 38</a> or of the fan shape shown
at <a href="#Fig039">Fig. 39</a>. This makes it possible to use a crank-case but
slightly larger than that needed for one or two cylinders
and it also permits of a corresponding decrease in length
of the crank-shaft. The weight of the engine is lessened
because of the reduction in crank-shaft and crank-case
weight and the elimination of a number of intermediate
bearings and their supporting webs which would be necessary
with the usual tandem construction. While there are
six power impulses to every two revolutions of the crank-shaft,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
in the six-cylinder engine, they are not evenly spaced
as is possible with the conventional arrangement.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="Fig038" id="Fig038"></a>
<img src="images/illo100.jpg" alt="Fig. 38" width="500" height="498" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 38.&mdash;Anzani 40-50 Horse-Power Five-Cylinder Air Cooled Engine.</p></div>

<p>In the Anzani form, which is shown at <a href="#Fig038">Fig. 38</a>, the crank-case
is stationary and a revolving crank-shaft is employed
as in conventional construction. The cylinders are five
in number and the engine develops 40 to 50 H.P. with a
weight of 72 kilograms or 158.4 lbs. The cylinders are of
the usual air-cooled form having cooling flanges only part
of the way down the cylinder. By using five cylinders it
is possible to have the power impulses come regularly,
they coming <span class="nowrap">145&deg;</span> crank-shaft travel apart, the crank-shaft
making two turns to every five explosions. The balance
is good and power output regular. The valves are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
placed directly in the cylinder head and are operated by
a common pushrod. Attention is directed to the novel
method of installing the carburetor which supplies the mixture
to the engine base from which inlet pipes radiate to
the various cylinders. This engine is used on French
school machines.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="Fig039" id="Fig039"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 39.&mdash;Unconventional Six-Cylinder Aircraft Motor of Masson Design.</p></div>

<p>In the form shown at <a href="#Fig039">Fig. 39</a> six cylinders are used,
all being placed above the crank-shaft center line. This
engine is also of the air-cooled form and develops 50 H. P.
and weighs 105 kilograms, or 231 lbs. The carburetor is
connected to a manifold casting attached to the engine base
from which the induction pipes radiate to the various
cylinders. The propeller design and size relative to the
engine is clearly shown in this view. While flights have
been made with both of the engines described, this method
of construction is not generally followed and has been
almost entirely displaced abroad by the revolving motors
or by the more conventional eight-cylinder V engines.
Both of the engines shown were designed about eight years<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
ago and would be entirely too small and weak for use in
modern airplanes intended for active duty.</p>

<h3><a name="SecIV_8" id="SecIV_8"></a>ROTARY ENGINES</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="Fig040" id="Fig040"></a>
<img src="images/illo102.jpg" alt="Fig. 40" width="500" height="504" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 40.&mdash;The Gnome Fourteen-Cylinder Revolving Motor.</p></div>

<p>Rotary engines such as shown at <a href="#Fig040">Fig. 40</a> are generally
associated with the idea of light construction and it is
rather an interesting point that is often overlooked in
connection with the application of this idea to flight
motors, that the reason why rotary engines are popularly
supposed to be lighter than the others is because they form
their own fly-wheel, yet on aeroplanes, engines are seldom
fitted with a fly-wheel at all. As a matter of fact the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Gnome engine is not so light because it is a rotary motor,
and it is a rotary motor because the design that has
been adopted as that most conducive to lightness is
also most suited to an engine working in this way.
The cylinders could be fixed and crank-shaft revolve
without increasing the weight to any extent. There
are two prime factors governing the lightness of an
engine, one being the initial design, and the other the
quality of the materials employed. The consideration
of reducing weight by cutting away metal is a subsidiary
method that ought not to play a part in standard
practice, however useful it may be in special cases. In
the Gnome rotary engine the lightness is entirely due to
the initial design and to the materials employed in manufacture.
Thus, in the first case, the engine is a radial
engine, and has its seven or nine cylinders spaced equally
around a crank-chamber that is no wider or rather longer
than would be required for any one of the cylinders.
This shortening of the crank-chamber not only effects
a considerable saving of weight on its own account, but
there is a corresponding saving in the shafts and other
members, the dimensions of which are governed by the
size of the crank-chamber. With regard to materials,
nothing but steel is used throughout, and most of the metal
is forged chrome nickel steel. The beautifully steady
running of the engine is largely due to the fact that there
are literally no reciprocating parts in the absolute sense,
the apparent reciprocation between the pistons and cylinders
being solely a relative reciprocation since both travel
in circular paths, that of the pistons, however, being
electric by one-half of the stroke length to that of the
cylinder.</p>

<p>While the Gnome engine has many advantages, on the
other hand the head resistance offered by a motor of this
type is considerable; there is a large waste of lubricating
oil due to the centrifugal force which tends to throw the
oil away from the cylinders; the gyroscopic effect of the
rotary motor is detrimental to the best working of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
aeroplane, and moreover it requires about seven per cent.
of the total power developed by the motor to drive the
revolving cylinders around the shaft. Of necessity, the
compression of this type of motor is rather low, and an
additional disadvantage manifests itself in the fact that
there is as yet no satisfactory way of muffling the rotary
type of motor. The modern Gnome engine has been widely
copied in various European countries, but its design was
originated in America, the early Adams-Farwell engine
being the pioneer form. It has been made in seven- and
nine-cylinder types and forms of double these numbers.
The engine illustrated at <a href="#Fig040">Fig. 40</a> is a fourteen-cylinder
form. The simple engines have an odd number of cylinders
in order to secure evenly spaced explosions. In the
seven-cylinder, the impulses come <span class="nowrap">102.8&deg;</span> apart. In the
nine-cylinder form, the power strokes are spaced <span class="nowrap">80&deg;</span> apart.
The fourteen-cylinder engine is virtually two seven-cylinder
types mounted together, the cranks being just the
same as in a double cylinder opposed motor, the explosions
coming <span class="nowrap">51.4&deg;</span> apart; while in the eighteen-cylinder model
the power impulses come every <span class="nowrap">40&deg;</span> cylinder travel. Other
rotary motors have been devised, such as the Le Rhone
and the Clerget in France and several German copies of
these various types. The mechanical features of these
motors will be fully considered <a href="#ChXII">later</a>.</p>

<p><a name="SecV_1" id="SecV_1"></a>There is no appliance that has more material value
upon the efficiency of the internal combustion motor than
the carburetor or vaporizer which supplies the explosive
gas to the cylinders. It is only in recent years that engineers
have realized the importance of using carburetors
that are efficient and that are so strongly and simply made
that there will be little liability of derangement. As the
power obtained from the gas-engine depends upon the
combustion of fuel in the cylinders, it is evident that if
the gas supplied does not have the proper proportions of
elements to insure rapid combustion the efficiency of the
engine will be low. When a gas engine is used as a stationary
installation it is possible to use ordinary illuminating
or natural gas for fuel, but when this prime mover is
applied to automobiles or airplanes it is evident that considerable
difficulty would be experienced in carrying enough
compressed coal gas to supply the engine for even a very
short trip. Fortunately, the development of the internal-combustion
motor was not delayed by the lack of suitable
fuel.</p>

<p>Engineers were familiar with the properties of certain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
liquids which gave off vapors that could be mixed with air
to form an explosive gas which burned very well in the
engine cylinders. A very small quantity of such liquids
would suffice for a very satisfactory period of operation.
The problem to be solved before these liquids could be
applied in a practical manner was to evolve suitable apparatus
for vaporizing them without waste. Among the
liquids that can be combined with air and burned, gasoline
is the most volatile and is the fuel utilized by internal-combustion
engines.</p>

<p>The widely increasing scope of usefulness of the internal-combustion
motor has made it imperative that other
fuels be applied in some instances because the supply of
gasoline may in time become inadequate to supply the
demand. In fact, abroad this fuel sells for fifty to two
hundred per cent. more than it does in America because
most of the gasoline used must be imported from this
country or Russia. Because of this foreign engineers have
experimented widely with other substances, such as alcohol,
benzol, and kerosene, but more to determine if they
can be used to advantage in motor cars than in airplane
engines.</p>

<h3><a name="SecV_2" id="SecV_2"></a>DISTILLATES OF CRUDE PETROLEUM</h3>

<p>Crude petroleum is found in small quantities in almost
all parts of the world, but a large portion of that produced
commercially is derived from American wells. The
petroleum obtained in this country yields more of the
volatile products than those of foreign production, and for
that reason the demand for it is greater. The oil fields
of this country are found in Pennsylvania, Indiana, and
Ohio, and the crude petroleum is usually in association
with natural gas. This mineral oil is an agent from which
many compounds and products are derived, and the products
will vary from heavy sludges, such as asphalt, to
the lighter and more volatile components, some of which
will evaporate very easily at ordinary temperatures.</p>

<p>The compounds derived from crude petroleum are composed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
principally of hydrogen and carbon and are termed
&#8220;Hydrocarbons.&#8221; In the crude product one finds many
impurities, such as free carbon, sulphur, and various
earthy elements. Before the oil can be utilized it must be
subjected to a process of purifying which is known as
refining, and it is during this process, which is one of
destructive distillation, that the various liquids are separated.
The oil was formerly broken up into three main
groups of products as follows: Highly volatile, naphtha,
benzine, gasoline, eight to ten per cent. Light oils, such
as kerosene and light lubricating oils seventy to eighty
per cent. Heavy oils or residuum five to nine per cent.
From the foregoing it will be seen that the available supply
of gasoline is determined largely by the demand existing
for the light oils forming the larger part of the
products derived from crude petroleum. New processes
have been recently discovered by which the lighter oils,
such as kerosene, are reduced in proportion and that of
gasoline increased, though the resulting liquid is neither
the high grade, volatile gasoline known in the early days
of motoring nor the low grade kerosene.</p>

<h3><a name="SecV_3" id="SecV_3"></a>PRINCIPLES OF CARBURETION OUTLINED</h3>

<p>The process of carburetion is combining the volatile
vapors which evaporate from the hydrocarbon liquids with
certain proportions of air to form an inflammable gas.
The quantities of air needed vary with different liquids
and some mixtures burn quicker than do other combinations
of air and vapor. Combustion is simply burning and
it may be rapid, moderate or slow. Mixtures of gasoline
and air burn quickly, in fact the combustion is so rapid
that it is almost instantaneous and we obtain what is
commonly termed an &#8220;explosion.&#8221; Therefore the explosion
of gas in the automobile engine cylinder which
produces the power is really a combination of chemical
elements which produce heat and an increase in the volume
of the gas because of the increase in temperature.</p>

<p>If the gasoline mixture is not properly proportioned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the rate of burning will vary, and if the mixture is either
too rich or too weak the power of the explosion is reduced
and the amount of power applied to the piston is decreased
proportionately. In determining the proper proportions
of gasoline and air, one must take the chemical
composition of gasoline into account. The ordinary liquid
used for fuel is said to contain about eight-four per cent.
carbon and sixteen per cent. hydrogen. Air is composed
of oxygen and nitrogen and the former has a great affinity,
or combining power, with the two constituents of hydro-carbon
liquids. Therefore, what we call an explosion is
merely an indication that oxygen in the air has combined
with the carbon and hydrogen of the gasoline.</p>

<h3><a name="SecV_4" id="SecV_4"></a>AIR NEEDED TO BURN GASOLINE</h3>

<p>In figuring the proper volume of air to mix with a
given quantity of fuel, one takes into account the fact that
one pound of hydrogen requires eight pounds of oxygen
to burn it, and one pound of carbon needs two and one-third
pounds of oxygen to insure its combustion. Air is
composed of one part of oxygen to three and one-half portions
of nitrogen by weight. Therefore for each pound of
oxygen one needs to burn hydrogen or carbon four and
one-half pounds of air must be allowed. To insure combustion
of one pound of gasoline which is composed of
hydrogen and carbon we must furnish about ten pounds
of air to burn the carbon and about six pounds of air to
insure combustion of hydrogen, the other component of
gasoline. This means that to burn one pound of gasoline
one must provide about sixteen pounds of air.</p>

<p>While one does not usually consider air as having much
weight, at a temperature of sixty-two degrees Fahrenheit
about fourteen cubic feet of air will weigh a pound, and
to burn a pound of gasoline one would require about two
hundred cubic feet of air. This amount will provide for
combustion theoretically, but it is common practice to
allow twice this amount because the element nitrogen,
which is the main constituent of air, is an inert gas and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
instead of aiding combustion it acts as a deterrent of
burning. In order to be explosive, gasoline vapor must
be combined with definite quantities of air. Mixtures that
are rich in gasoline ignite quicker than those which have
more air, but these are only suitable when starting or
when running slowly, as a rich mixture ignites much
quicker than a weak mixture. The richer mixture of
gasoline and air not only burns quicker but produces the
most heat and the most effective pressure in pounds per
square inch of piston top area.</p>

<p>The amount of compression of the charge before ignition
also has material bearing on the force of the explosion.
The higher the degree of compression the greater
the force exerted by the rapid combustion of the gas. It
may be stated that as a general thing the maximum explosive
pressure is somewhat more than four times the
compression pressure prior to ignition. A charge compressed
to sixty pounds will have a maximum of approximately
two hundred and forty pounds; compacted to
eighty pounds it will produce a pressure of about three
hundred pounds on each square inch of piston area at
the beginning of the power stroke. Mixtures varying
from one part of gasoline vapor to four of air to others
having one part of gasoline vapor to thirteen of air can
be ignited, but the best results are obtained when the
proportions are one to five or one to seven, as this mixture
is said to be the one that will produce the highest
temperature, the quickest explosion, and the most
pressure.</p>

<h3><a name="SecV_5" id="SecV_5"></a>WHAT A CARBURETOR SHOULD DO</h3>

<p>While it is apparent that the chief function of a carbureting
device is to mix hydrocarbon vapors with air to
secure mixtures that will burn, there are a number of factors
which must be considered before describing the principles
of vaporizing devices. Almost any device which
permits a current of air to pass over or through a volatile
liquid will produce a gas which will explode when<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
compressed and ignited in the motor cylinder. Modern
carburetors are not only called upon to supply certain
quantities of gas, but these must deliver a mixture to the
cylinders that is accurately proportioned and which will
be of proper composition at all engine speeds.</p>

<p>Flexible control of the engine is sought by varying the
engine speed by regulating the supply of gas to the cylinders.
The power plant should run from its lowest to its
highest speed without any irregularity in torque, i.e., the
acceleration should be gradual rather than spasmodic. As
the degree of compression will vary in value with the
amount of throttle opening, the conditions necessary to
obtain maximum power differ with varying engine speeds.
When the throttle is barely opened the engine speed is
low and the gas must be richer in fuel than when the
throttle is wide open and the engine speed high.</p>

<p>When an engine is turning over slowly the compression
has low value and the conditions are not so favorable to
rapid combustion as when the compression is high. At
high engine speeds the gas velocity through the intake
piping is higher than at low speeds, and regular engine
action is not so apt to be disturbed by condensation of
liquid fuel in the manifold due to excessively rich mixture
or a superabundance of liquid in the stream of carbureted
air.</p>

<h3><a name="SecV_6" id="SecV_6"></a>LIQUID FUEL STORAGE AND SUPPLY</h3>

<p>The problem of gasoline storage and method of supplying
the carburetor is one that is determined solely by
design of the airplane. While the object of designers
should be to supply the fuel to the carburetor by as simple
means as possible the fuel supply system of some airplanes
is quite complex. The first point to consider is the location
of the gasoline tank. This depends upon the amount
of fuel needed and the space available in the fuselage.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="Fig041" id="Fig041"></a>
<p class="leftlink"><a href="images/large110.jpg">Large<br />image<br />(193 kB).</a></p>
<img src="images/illo110.jpg" alt="Fig. 41" width="500" height="298" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 41.&mdash;How Gravity Feed Fuel Tank May Be Mounted Back of Engine and Secure Short Fuel Line.</p></div>

<p>A very simple and compact fuel supply system is shown
at <a href="#Fig041">Fig. 41</a>. In this instance the fuel container is placed
immediately back of the engine cylinder. The carburetor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
which is carried as indicated is joined to the tank by a
short piece of copper or flexible rubber tubing. This is
the simplest possible form of fuel supply system and one
used on a number of excellent airplanes.</p>

<p>As the sizes of engines increase and the power plant
fuel consumption augments it is necessary to use more
fuel, and to obtain a satisfactory flying radius without
frequent landings for filling the fuel tank it is necessary
to supply large containers.</p>

<p>When a very powerful power plant is fitted, as on
battle planes of high capacity, it is necessary to carry
large quantities of gasoline. In order to use a tank of
sufficiently large capacity it may be necessary to carry it
lower than the carburetor. When installed in this manner
it is necessary to force fuel out of the tank by air pressure
or to pump it with a vacuum tank because the gasoline
tank is lower than the carburetor it supplies and the gasoline
cannot flow by gravity as in the simpler systems.
While the pressure and gravity feed systems are generally
used in airplanes, it may be well to describe the vacuum
lift system which has been widely applied to motor cars
and which may have some use in connection with airplanes
as these machines are developed.</p>

<h3><a name="SecV_7" id="SecV_7"></a>STEWART VACUUM FUEL FEED</h3>

<p>One of the marked tendencies has been the adoption
of a vacuum fuel feed system to draw the gasoline from
tanks placed lower than the carburetor instead of using
either exhaust gas or air pressure to achieve this end. The
device generally fitted is the Stewart vacuum feed tank
which is clearly shown in section at <a href="#Fig042">Fig. 42</a>. In this system
the suction of a motor is employed to draw gasoline
from the main fuel tank to the auxiliary tank incorporated
in the device and from this tank the liquid flows to the
carburetor. It is claimed that all the advantages of the
pressure system are obtained with very little more complication
than is found on the ordinary gravity feed. The
mechanism is all contained in the cylindrical tank shown,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
which may be mounted either on the front of the dash or
on the side of the engine as shown.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="Fig042" id="Fig042"></a>
<img src="images/illo113.png" alt="Fig. 42" width="450" height="501" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 42.&mdash;The Stewart Vacuum Fuel Feed Tank.</p></div>

<p>The tank is divided into two chambers, the upper one
being the filling chamber and the lower one the emptying
chamber. The former, which is at the top of the device,
contains the float valve, as well as the pipes running to
the main fuel container and to the intake manifold. The
lower chamber is used to supply the carburetor with gasoline
and is under atmospheric pressure at all times, so the
flow of fuel from it is by means of gravity only. Since<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
this chamber is located somewhat above the carburetor,
there must always be free flow of fuel. Atmospheric pressure
is maintained by the pipes A and B, the latter opening
into the air. In order that the fuel will be sucked
from a main tank to the upper chamber, the suction valve
must be opened and the atmospheric valve closed. Under
these conditions the float is at the bottom and the suction
at the intake manifold produces a vacuum in the tank
which draws the gasoline from the main tank to the upper
chamber. When the upper chamber is filled at the proper
height the float rises to the top, this closing the suction
valve and opening the atmospheric valve. As the suction
is now cut off, the lower chamber is filled by gravity owing
to there being atmospheric pressure in both upper and
lower chambers. A flap valve is provided between the
two chambers to prevent the gasoline in the lower one
from being sucked back into the upper one. The atmospheric
and suction valves are controlled by the levers C
and D, both of which are pivoted at E, their outer ends
being connected by two coil springs. It is seen that the
arrangement of these two springs is such that the float
must be held at the extremity of its movement, and that
it cannot assume an intermediate position.</p>

<p>This intermittent action is required to insure that the
upper part of the tank may be under atmospheric pressure
part of the time for the gasoline to flow to the lower chamber.
When the level of gasoline drops to a certain point,
the float falls, thus opening the suction valve and closing
the atmospheric valve. The suction of the motor then
causes a flow of fuel from the main container. As soon
as the level rises to the proper height the float returns to
its upper position. It takes about two seconds for the
chamber to become full enough to raise the float, as but
.05 gallon is transferred at a time. The pipe running from
the bottom of the lower chamber to the carburetor extends
up a ways, so that there is but little chance of dirt or water
being carried to the float chamber.</p>

<p>If the engine is allowed to stand long enough so that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
tank becomes empty, it will be replenished after the motor
has been cranked over four or five times with the throttle
closed. The installation of the Stewart Vacuum-Gravity
System is very simple. The suction pipe is tapped into
the manifold at a point as near the cylinders as possible,
while the fuel pipe is inserted into the gasoline tank and
runs to the bottom of that member. There is a screen at
the end of the fuel pipe to prevent any trouble due to deposits
of sediment in the main container. As the fuel is
sucked from the gasoline tank a small vent must be made
in the tank filler cap so that the pressure in the main tank
will always be that of the atmosphere.</p>

<h3><a name="SecV_8" id="SecV_8"></a>EARLY VAPORIZER FORMS</h3>

<p>The early types of carbureting devices were very crude
and cumbersome, and the mixture of gasoline vapor and
air was accomplished in three ways. The air stream was
passed over the surface of the liquid itself, through loosely
placed absorbent material saturated with liquid, or directly
through the fuel. The first type is known as the surface
carburetor and is now practically obsolete. The second
form is called the &#8220;wick&#8221; carburetor because the air
stream was passed over or through saturated wicking. The
third form was known as a &#8220;bubbling&#8221; carburetor. While
these primitive forms gave fairly good results with the
early slow-speed engines and the high grade, or very
volatile, gasoline which was first used for fuel, they would
be entirely unsuitable for present forms of engines because
they would not carburate the lower grades of gasoline
which are used to-day, and would not supply the
modern high-speed engines with gas of the proper consistency
fast enough even if they did not have to use very
volatile gasoline. The form of carburetor used at the
present time operates on a different principle. These
devices are known as &#8220;spraying carburetors.&#8221; The fuel
is reduced to a spray by the suction effect of the entering
air stream drawing it through a fine opening.</p>

<p>The advantage of this construction is that a more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
thorough amalgamation of the gasoline and air particles
is obtained. With the earlier types previously considered
the air would combine with only the more volatile elements,
leaving the heavier constituents in the tank. As the fuel
became stale it was difficult to vaporize it, and it had to
be drained off and fresh fuel provided before the proper
mixture would be produced. It will be evident that when
the fuel is sprayed into the air stream, all the fuel will be
used up and the heavier portions of the gasoline will be
taken into the cylinder and vaporized just as well as the
more volatile vapors.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 43.&mdash;Marine-Type Mixing Valve, by which Gasoline is Sprayed into Air
Stream Through Small Opening in Air-Valve Seat.</p></div>

<p>The simplest form of spray carburetor is that shown
at <a href="#Fig043">Fig. 43</a>. In this the gasoline opening through
which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the fuel is sprayed into the entering air stream is closed
by the spring-controlled mushroom valve which regulates
the main air opening as well. When the engine draws in
a charge of air it unseats the valve and at the same time
the air flowing around it is saturated with gasoline particles
through the gasoline opening. The mixture thus
formed goes to the engine through the mixture passage.
Two methods of varying the fuel proportions are provided.
One of these consists of a needle valve to regulate the
amount of gasoline, the other is a knurled screw which
controls the amount of air by limiting the lift of the
jump valve.</p>

<h3><a name="SecV_9" id="SecV_9"></a>DEVELOPMENT OF FLOAT-FEED CARBURETOR</h3>

<p>The modern form of spraying carburetor is provided
with two chambers, one a mixing chamber through which
the air stream passes and mixes with a gasoline spray,
the other a float chamber in which a constant level of fuel
is maintained by simple mechanism. A jet or standpipe
is used in the mixing chamber to spray the fuel through
and the object of the float is to maintain the fuel level
to such a point that it will not overflow the jet when the
motor is not drawing in a charge of gas. With the simple
forms of generator valve in which the gasoline opening is
controlled by the air valve, a leak anywhere in either
valve or valve seat will allow the gasoline to flow continuously
whether the engine is drawing in a charge or not.
The liquid fuel collects around the air opening, and when
the engine inspires a charge it is saturated with gasoline
globules and is excessively rich. With a float-feed construction,
which maintains a constant level of gasoline at
the right height in the standpipe, liquid fuel will only be
supplied when drawn out of the jet by the suction effect
of the entering air stream.</p>

<h3><a name="SecV_10" id="SecV_10"></a>MAYBACH&#8217;S EARLY DESIGN</h3>

<p>The first form of spraying carburetor ever applied
successfully was evolved by Maybach for use on one of the<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a></span>
earliest Daimler engines. The general principles of operation
of this pioneer float-feed carburetor are shown at
<a href="#Fig044">Fig. 44</a>, A. The mixing chamber and valve chamber were
one and the standpipe or jet protruded into the mixing
chamber. It was connected to the float compartment by a
pipe. The fuel from the tank entered the top of the float
compartment and the opening was closed by a needle
valve carried on top of a hollow metal float. When the
level of gasoline in the float chamber was lowered the
float would fall and the needle valve uncover the opening.
This would permit the gasoline from the tank to flow into
the float chamber, and as the chamber filled the float would
rise until the proper level had been reached, under which
conditions the float would shut off the gasoline opening.
On every suction stroke of the engine the inlet valve, which
was an automatic type, would leave its seat and a stream
of air would be drawn through the air opening and around
the standpipe or jet. This would cause the gasoline to
spray out of the tube and mix with the entering air stream.</p>

Carburetor.</p></div>

<p>The form shown at <a href="#Fig044">B</a> was a modification of Maybach&#8217;s
simple device and was first used on the Ph&oelig;nix-Daimler
engines. Several improvements are noted in this device.
First, the carburetor was made one unit by casting the
float and mixing chambers together instead of making them
separate and joining them by a pipe, as shown at <a href="#Fig044">A</a>. The
float construction was improved and the gasoline shut-off
valve was operated through leverage instead of being directly
fastened to the float. The spray nozzle was surrounded
by a choke tube which concentrated the air stream
around it and made for more rapid air flow at low engine
speeds. A conical piece was placed over the jet to break
up the entering spray into a mist and insure more intimate
admixture of air and gasoline. The air opening was
provided with an air cone which had a shutter controlling
the opening so that the amount of air entering could be
regulated and thus vary the mixture proportions within
certain limits.</p>

<h3><a name="SecV_11" id="SecV_11"></a>CONCENTRIC FLOAT AND JET TYPE</h3>

<p>The form shown at <a href="#Fig044">B</a> has been further improved, and
the type shown at <a href="#Fig044">C</a> is representative of modern single
jet practice. In this the float chamber and mixing chamber
are concentric. A balanced float mechanism which insures
steadiness of feed is used, the gasoline jet or standpipe
is provided with a needle valve to vary the amount of
gasoline supplied the mixture and two air openings are
provided. The main air port is at the bottom of the
vaporizer, while an auxiliary air inlet is provided at the
side of the mixing chamber. There are two methods of
controlling the mixture proportions in this form of carburetor.
One may regulate the gasoline needle or adjust
the auxiliary air valve.</p>

<h3><a name="SecV_12" id="SecV_12"></a>SCHEBLER CARBURETOR</h3>

<p>A Schebler carburetor, which has been used on some
airplane engines, is shown in <a href="#Fig045">Fig. 45</a>. It will be noticed
that a metering pin or needle valve opens the jet when
the air valve opens. The long arm of a leverage is connected
to the air valve, while the short arm is connected
to the needle, the reduction in leverage being such that
the needle valve is made to travel much less than the air
valve. For setting the amount of fuel passed or the size
of the jet orifice when running with the air valve closed,
there is a screw which raises or lowers the fulcrum of
the lever and there is also a dash control having the same
effect by pushing down the fulcrum against a small spring.
A long extension is given to the venturi tube which is very
narrow around the jet orifices, which are horizontal and
shown at A in the drawing. Fuel enters the float chamber
through the union M, and the spring P holds the metering
pin upward against the restraining action of the lever.
The air valve may be set by an easily adjustable knurled
screw shown in the drawing, and fluttering of the valve is
prevented by the piston dash pot carried in a chamber
above the valve into which the valve stem projects. The<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a></span>
primary air enters beneath the jet passage and there is
a small throttle in the intake to increase the speed of air
flow for starting purposes. The carburetor is adapted for
the use of a hot-air connection to the stove around the
exhaust pipe and it is recommended that such a fitting be
supplied. The lever which controls the supply of air
through the primary air intake is so arranged that if
desired it can be connected with a linkage on the dash
or control column by means of a flexible wire.</p>

<h3><a name="SecV_13" id="SecV_13"></a>THE CLAUDEL (FRENCH) CARBURETOR</h3>

<p>This carburetor is of extremely simple construction,
because it has no supplementary or auxiliary air valve
and no moving parts except the throttle controlling the
gas flow. The construction is already shown in <a href="#Fig046">Fig. 46</a>.<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
The spray jet is eccentric with a surrounding sleeve or
tube in which there are two series of small orifices, one
at the top and the other near the bottom. The former
are about level with the spray jet opening. The sleeve
surrounding the nozzle is closed at the top. The air,
passing the upper holes in the sleeve, produces a vacuum
in the sleeve, thereby drawing air in through the bottom
holes. It is this moving interior column of air that controls
the flow of gasoline from the nozzle. Owing to the
friction of the small passages, the speed of air flow through
the sleeve does not increase as fast as the speed of air
flow outside the sleeve, hence there is a tendency for the
mixture to remain constant. The throttle of this carburetor
is of the barrel type, and the top of the spray nozzle
and its surrounding sleeve are located inside the throttle.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 46.&mdash;The Claudel Carburetor.</p></div>

<h3><a name="SecV_14" id="SecV_14"></a>STEWART METERING PIN CARBURETOR</h3>

<p>The carburetor shown at <a href="#Fig047">Fig. 47</a> is a metering type in
which the vacuum at the jet is controlled by the weight
of the metering valve surrounding the upright metering
pin. The only moving part is the metering valve, which
rises and falls with the changes in vacuum. The air
chamber surrounds the metering valve, and there is a mixing
chamber above. As the valve is drawn up the gasoline
passage is enlarged on account of the predetermined taper
on the metering pin, and the air passage also is increased
proportionately, giving the correct mixture. A dashpot
at the bottom of the valve checks flutter. In idling the
valve rests on its seat, practically closing the air and giving
the necessary idling mixture. A passage through the
valve acts as an aspirating tube. When the valve is closed
altogether the primary air passes through ducts in the
valve itself, giving the proper amount for idling. The
one adjustment consists in raising or lowering the tapered
metering pin, increasing or decreasing the supply of
gasoline. Dash control is supplied. This pulls down the
metering pin, increasing the gasoline flow. The duplex
type for eight- and twelve-cylinder motors is the same in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
principle as model 25, but it is a double carburetor synchronized
as to throttle movements, adjustments, etc. The
duplex for aeronautical motors is made of cast aluminum
alloy.</p>

<h3><a name="SecV_15" id="SecV_15"></a>MULTIPLE NOZZLE VAPORIZERS</h3>

<p>To secure properly proportioned mixtures some carburetor
designers have evolved forms in which two or
more nozzles are used in a common mixing chamber. The
usual construction is to use two, one having a small opening
and placed in a small air tube and used only for low<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
speeds, the other being placed in a larger air tube and
having a slightly augmented bore so that it is employed
on intermediate speeds. At high speeds both jets would
be used in series. Some multiple jet carburetors could
be considered as a series of these instruments, each one
being designed for certain conditions of engine action.
They would vary from small size just sufficient to run
the engine at low speed to others having sufficient capacity
to furnish gas for the highest possible engine speed when
used in conjunction with the smaller members which have
been brought into service progressively as the engine speed
has been augmented. The multiple nozzle carburetor differs
from that in which a single spray tube is used only
in the construction of the mixing chamber, as a common
float bowl can be used to supply all spray pipes. It is
common practice to bring the jets into action progressively
by some form of mechanical connection with the
throttle or by automatic valves.</p>

<p>The object of any multiple nozzle carburetor is to
secure greater flexibility and endeavor to supply mixtures
of proper proportions at all speeds of the engine.
It should be stated, however, that while devices of this
nature lend themselves readily to practical application it
is more difficult to adjust them than the simpler forms
having but one nozzle. When a number of jets are used
the liability of clogging up the carburetor is increased,
and if one or more of the nozzles is choked by a particle
of dirt or water the resulting mixture trouble is difficult
to detect. One of the nozzles may supply enough gasoline
to permit the engine to run well at certain speeds and yet
not be adequate to supply the proper amount of gas under
other conditions. In adjusting a multiple jet carburetor
in which the jets are provided with gasoline regulating
needles, it is customary to consider each nozzle as a distinct
carburetor and to regulate it to secure the best motor
action at that throttle position which corresponds to the
conditions under which the jet is brought into service.
For instance, that supplied the primary mixing chamber<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
should be regulated with the throttle partly closed, while
the auxiliary jet should be adjusted with the throttle fully
opened.</p>

<h3><a name="SecV_16" id="SecV_16"></a>BALL AND BALL TWO-STAGE CARBURETOR</h3>

<p>This is a two-stage vaporizing device, hot air being
used in the primary or initial stage of vaporization and
cold air in the supplementary stage. Referring to the
sectional illustration at <a href="#Fig048">Fig. 48</a>, it will be seen that there
is a hot-air passage with a choke-valve; the primary venturi
appears at B; J is its gasoline jet, and V is a spring-loaded
idling valve in a fixed air opening. These parts
constitute the primary system. In the secondary system
A is a cold-air passage, T a butterfly valve and J a gasoline
jet discharging into the cold-air passage. This system
is brought into operation by opening the butterfly T.
A connection between the butterfly T and the throttle, not
shown, throws the butterfly wide open when the throttle
is not quite wide open; at all other times the butterfly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
is held closed by a spring. The cylindrical chamber at
the right of the mixing chamber has an extension E of
reduced diameter connecting it with the intake manifold
through a passage D. A restricted opening connects the
float chamber with the cylindrical chamber so that the
gasoline level is the same in both. A loosely fitting plunger
P in the cylindrical chamber has an upward extension
into the small part of the chamber. O is a small air
opening and M is a passage from the cylindrical chamber
to the mixing chamber. Air constantly passes through
this when the carburetor is in operation. The carburetor
is really two in one. The primary carburetor is made up
of a central jet in a venturi passage. The float chamber
is eccentric. In the air passage there is a fixed opening,
and additional air is taken in by the opening through
suction of a spring-opposed air valve. The second stage,
which comes into play as soon as the carburetor is called
upon for additional mixture above low medium speeds,
is made up of an independent air passage containing another
air valve. As the valve is opened this jet is uncovered,
and air is led past it. For easy starting an
extra passage leads from the float bowl passage to a point
above the throttle. All the suction falls upon this passage
when the throttle is closed. The passage contains a plunger
and acts as a pick-up device. When the vacuum increases
the plunger rises and shuts off the flow of gasoline
from the intake passage. As the throttle is opened the
vacuum in the intake passage is broken, and the plunger
falls, causing gasoline to gather above it. This is immediately
drawn through the pick-up passage and gives the
desired mixture for acceleration.</p>

<h3><a name="SecV_17" id="SecV_17"></a>MASTER MULTIPLE-JET CARBURETOR</h3>

<p>This carburetor, shown in detail in <a href="#Fig049">Figs. 49</a> and <a href="#Fig050">50</a>,
has been very popular in racing cars and aviation engines
because of exceptionally good pick-up qualities and its
thorough atomization of fuel. Its principle of operation
is the breaking up of the fuel by a series of jets, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
vary in number from fourteen to twenty-one, according
to the size of the carburetor. These are uncovered by
opening the throttle, which is curved&mdash;a patented feature&mdash;to
secure the correct progression of jets. The carburetor
has an eccentric float chamber, from which the gasoline
is led to the jet piece from which the jets stand up
in a row. The tops of these jets are closed until the
throttle is opened far enough to pass them, which it does
progressively. The air opening is at the bottom, and the
throttle opening is such that a modified venturi is formed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
The throttle is carried in a cylindrical barrel with the jets
placed below it, and the passage from the barrel to the
intake is arranged so that there is no interruption in the
flow. For easy starting a dash-controlled shutter closes
off the air, throwing the suction on the jets, thus giving
a rich mixture.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="Fig049" id="Fig049"></a>

<p>The only adjustment is for idling, and once that is
fixed it need never be touched. This is in the form of
a screw and regulates the position of the throttle when
at idling position. The dash control has high-speed, normal
and rich-starting positions. In installing the Master
carburetor the float chamber may be turned either toward
the radiator or driver&#8217;s seat. If the float is turned toward
the radiator, however, a forward lug plate should be
ordered; otherwise it will be difficult to install the control.
The throttle lever must go all the way to the stop lug<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
or maximum power will not be secured. In adjusting the
idle screw it is turned in for rich and out for lean.</p>

<h3><a name="SecV_18" id="SecV_18"></a>COMPOUND NOZZLE ZENITH CARBURETOR</h3>

<p>The Zenith carburetor, shown at <a href="#Fig051">Fig. 51</a>, has become
very popular for airplane engine use because of its simplicity,
as mixture compensation is secured by a compensating
compound nozzle principle that works very well in
practice. To illustrate this principle briefly, let us consider
the elementary type of carburetor or mixing valve,
as shown in <a href="#Fig052">Fig. 52</a>, A. It consists of a single jet or
spraying nozzle placed in the path of the incoming air
and fed from the usual float chamber. It is a natural<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137"
id="Page_137">[137]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a></span>
inference to suppose that as the speed of the motor increases,
both the flow of air and of gasoline will increase
in the same proportion. Unhappily, such is not the case.
There is a law of liquid bodies which states that the flow
of gasoline from the jet increases under suction faster
than the flow of air, giving a mixture which grows richer
and richer&mdash;a mixture containing a much higher percentage
of gasoline at high suction than at low. The tendency
is shown by the accompanying curve (<a href="#Fig052">Fig. 52</a>, B), which
gives the ratio of gasoline to air at varying speeds from
this type of jet. The mixture is practically constant only
between narrow limits and at very high speed. The most
common method of correcting this defect is by putting
various auxiliary air valves which, adding air, tends to
dilute this mixture as it gets too rich. It is difficult with
makeshift devices to gauge this dilution accurately for
every motor speed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="Fig051" id="Fig051"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 52.&mdash;Diagrams Explaining Action of Baverey Compound Nozzle Used in Zenith Carburetor.</p></div>

<p>Now, if we have a jet which grows richer as the suction
increases, the opposite type of jet is one which would
grow leaner under similar conditions. Baverey, the inventor
of the Zenith, discovered the principle of the constant
flow device which is shown in <a href="#Fig052">Fig. 52</a>, C. Here
a certain fixed amount of gasoline determined by the opening
I is permitted to flow by gravity into the well J open
to the air. The suction at jet H has no effect upon the
gravity compensator I because the suction is destroyed
by the open well J. The compensator, then, delivers a
steady rate of flow per unit of time, and as the motor
suction increases more air is drawn up, while the amount
of gasoline remains the same and the mixture grows
poorer and poorer. <a href="#Fig052">Fig. 52</a>, D, shows this curve.</p>

<p>By combining these two types of rich and poor mixture
carburetors the Zenith compound nozzle was evolved. In
<a href="#Fig052">Fig. 52</a>, E, we have both the direct suction or richer type
leading through pipe E and nozzle G and the &#8220;constant
flow&#8221; device of Baverey shown at J, I, K and nozzle H.
One counteracts the defects of the other, so that from
the cranking of the motor to its highest speed there is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
a constant ratio of air and gasoline to supply efficient
combustion.</p>

<p>In addition to the compound nozzle the Zenith is
equipped with a starting and idling well, shown in the
<a href="#Fig051">cut</a> of Model L carburetor at P and J. This terminates
in a priming hole at the edge of the butterfly valve,
where the suction is greatest when this valve is slightly
open. The gasoline is drawn up by the suction at the
priming hole and, mixed with the air rushing by the butterfly,
gives an ideal slow speed mixture. At higher speeds
with the butterfly valve opened further the priming well
ceases to operate and the compound nozzle drains the well
and compensates correctly for any motor speed.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 53.&mdash;The Zenith Duplex Carburetor for Airplane Motors of the V Type.</p></div>

<p>With the coming of the double motor containing eight
or twelve cylinders arranged in two V blocks, the question
of good carburetion has been a problem requiring much
study. The single carburetor has given only indifferent
results due to the strong cross suction in the inlet manifold
from one set of cylinders to the other. This naturally
led to the adoption of two carburetors in which each
set of cylinders was independently fed by a separate carburetor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Results from this system were very good when
the two carburetors were working exactly in unison, but
as it was extremely difficult to accomplish this co-operation,
especially where the adjustable type was employed,
this system never gained in favor. The next logical step
was the Zenith Duplex, shown at <a href="#Fig053">Fig. 53</a>. This consists
of two separate and distinct carburetors joined together
so that a common gasoline float chamber and air inlet
could be used by both. It does away with cross suction
in the manifold because each set of cylinders has a separate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
intake of its own. It does away with two carburetors
and makes for simplicity. The practical application
of the Zenith carburetor to the Curtiss 90 horse-power
OX-2 motor used on the JN-4 standard training machine
is shown at <a href="#Fig054">Fig. 54</a>, which outlines a rear view of the
engine in question. The carburetor is carried low to permit
of fuel supply from a gravity tank carried back of
the motor.</p>

<h3><a name="SecV_19" id="SecV_19"></a>UTILITY OF GASOLINE STRAINERS</h3>

<p>Many carburetors include a filtering screen at the point
where the liquid enters the float chamber in order to keep
dirt or any other foreign matter which may be present
in the fuel from entering the float chamber. This is not
general practice, however, and the majority of vaporizers
do not include a filter in their construction. It is very
desirable that the dirt should be kept out of the carburetor
because it may get under the float control fuel valve
and cause flooding by keeping it raised from its seat. If
it finds its way into the spray nozzle it may block the
opening so that no gasoline will issue or may so constrict
the passage that only very small quantities of fuel will
be supplied the mixture. Where the carburetor itself is
not provided with a filtering screen a simple filter is
usually installed in the pipe line between the gasoline
tank and the float chamber.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="Fig055" id="Fig055"></a>
<img src="images/illo136.png" alt="Fig. 55" width="450" height="469" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 55.&mdash;Types of Strainers Interposed Between Vaporizer and Gasoline
Tank to Prevent Water or Dirt Passing Into Carbureting Device.</p></div>

<p>Some simple forms of filters and separators are shown
at <a href="#Fig055">Fig. 55</a>. That at A consists of a simple brass casting
having a readily detachable gauze screen and a settling
chamber of sufficient capacity to allow the foreign matter
to settle to the bottom, from which it is drained out by
a pet cock. Any water or dirt in the gasoline will settle
to the bottom of the chamber, and as all fuel delivered
to the carburetor must pass through the wire gauze screen
it is not likely to contain impurities when it reaches the
float chamber. The heavier particles, such as scale from
the tank or dirt and even water, all of which have greater
weight than the gasoline, will sink to the bottom of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
chamber, whereas light particles, such as lint, will be prevented
from flowing into the carburetor by the filtering
screen.</p>

<p>The filtering device shown at B is a larger appliance
than that shown at A, and should be more efficient as a
separator because the gasoline is forced to pass through
three filtering screens before it reaches the carburetor.
The gasoline enters the device shown at C through a bent
pipe which leads directly to the settling chamber and
from thence through a wire gauze screen to the upper
compartment which leads to the carburetor. The device
shown at D is a combination strainer, drain, and sediment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
cup. The filtering screen is held in place by a
spring and both are removed by taking out a plug at the
bottom of the device. The shut-off valve at the top of
the device is interposed between the sediment cup and
the carburetor. This separating device is incorporated
with the gasoline tank and forms an integral part of the
gasoline supply system. The other types shown are designed
to be interposed between the gasoline tank and
the carburetor at any point in the pipe line where they
may be conveniently placed.</p>

<h3><a name="SecV_20" id="SecV_20"></a>INTAKE MANIFOLD DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION</h3>

<p>On four- and six-cylinder engines and in fact on all
multiple-cylinder forms, it is important that the piping
leading from the carburetor to the cylinders be made in
such a way that the various cylinders will receive their
full quota of gas and that each cylinder will receive its
charge at about the same point in the cycle of operations.
In order to make the passages direct the bends should
be as few as possible, and when curves are necessary they
should be of large radius because an abrupt corner will not
only impede gas flow but will tend to promote condensation
of the fuel. Every precaution should be taken with four- and
six-cylinder engines to insure equitable gas distribution
to the valve chambers if regular action of the
power plant is desired. If the gas pipe has many turns
and angles it will be difficult to charge all cylinders properly.
On some six-cylinder aviation engines, two carburetors
are used because of trouble experienced with manifolds
designed for one carburetor. Duplex carburetors
are necessary to secure the best results from eight- and
twelve-cylinder V engines.</p>

<p>The problem of intake piping is simplified to some
extent on block motors where the intake passage is cored
in the cylinder casting and where but one short pipe is
needed to join this passage to the carburetor. If the
cylinders are cast in pairs a simple pipe of T or Y form
can be used with success. When the engine is of a type<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
using individual cylinder castings, especially in the six-cylinder
power plants, the proper application and installation
of suitable piping is a difficult problem. The reader
is referred to the various engine designs outlined to ascertain
how the inlet piping has been arranged on representative
aviation engines. Intake piping is constructed
in two ways, the most common method being to cast the
manifold of brass or aluminum. The other method, which
is more costly, is to use a built-up construction of copper
or brass tubing with cast metal elbows and Y pieces. One
of the disadvantages advanced against the cast manifold
is that blowholes may exist which produce imperfect castings
and which will cause mixture troubles because the
entering gas from the carburetor, which may be of proper
proportions, is diluted by the excess air which leaks in
through the porous casting. Another factor of some moment
is that the roughness of the walls has a certain
amount of friction which tends to reduce the velocity of
the gases, and when projecting pieces are present, such
as core wire or other points of metal, these tend to collect
the drops of liquid fuel and thus promote condensation.
The advantage of the built-up construction is that the
walls of the tubing are very smooth, and as the castings
are small it is not difficult to clean them out thoroughly
before they are incorporated in the manifold. The tubing
and castings are joined together by hard soldering, brazing
or autogenous welding.</p>

<h3><a name="SecV_21" id="SecV_21"></a>COMPENSATING FOR VARYING ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS</h3>

<p>The low-grade gasoline used at the present time makes
it necessary to use vaporizers that are more susceptible
to atmospheric variations than when higher grade and
more volatile liquids are vaporized. Sudden temperature
changes, sometimes being as much as forty degrees rise
or fall in twelve hours, affect the mixture proportions to
some extent, and not only changes in temperature but
variations in altitude also have a bearing on mixture proportions
by affecting both gasoline and air. As the temperature<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
falls the specific gravity of the gasoline increases
and it becomes heavier, this producing difficulty in vaporizing.
The tendency of very cold air is to condense gasoline
instead of vaporizing it and therefore it is necessary
to supply heated air to some carburetors to obtain proper
mixtures during cold weather. In order that the gas mixtures
will ignite properly the fuel must be vaporized and
thoroughly mixed with the entering air either by heat or
high velocity of the gases. The application of air stoves
to the Curtiss OX-2 motor is clearly shown at <a href="#Fig054">Fig. 54</a>. It
will be seen that flexible metal pipes are used to convey
the heated air to the air intakes of the duplex mixing
chamber.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="Fig056" id="Fig056"></a>
<img src="images/illo139.png" alt="Fig. 56" width="450" height="343" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 56.&mdash;Chart Showing Diminution of Air Pressure as Altitude Increases.</p></div>

<h3><a name="SecV_22" id="SecV_22"></a>HOW HIGH ALTITUDE AFFECTS POWER</h3>

<p>Any internal combustion engine will show less power
at high altitudes than it will deliver at sea level, and this
has caused a great deal of questioning. &#8220;There is a good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
reason for this,&#8221; says a writer in &#8220;Motor Age,&#8221; &#8220;and
it is a physical impossibility for the engine to do otherwise.
The difference is due to the lower atmospheric
pressure the higher up we get. That is, at sea level the
atmosphere has a pressure of 14.7 pounds per square inch;
at 5,000 feet above sea level the pressure is approximately
12.13 pounds per square inch, and at 10,000 feet it is 10
pounds per square inch. From this it will be seen that
the final pressure attained after the piston has driven
the gas into compressed condition ready for firing is lower
as the atmospheric pressure drops. This means that there
is not so much power in the compressed charge of gas the
higher up you get above sea level.</p>

<p>&#8220;For example, suppose the compression ratio to be
4<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1; in other words, suppose the air space above the
piston to have 4<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> times the volume when the piston is
at the bottom of its stroke that it has when the piston is
at the top of the stroke. That is a common compression
ratio for an average motor, and is chosen because it is
considered to be the best for maximum horse-power and
in order that the compression pressure will not be so high
as to cause pre-ignition. Knowing the compression ratio,
we can determine the final pressure immediately before
ignition by substituting in the standard formula:</p>

<table class="formula" summary="Formula p 145">

<tr>
<td rowspan="2" class="center">P<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td>
<td rowspan="2" class="center fsize150">(</td>
<td class="center bb">V</td>
<td rowspan="2" class="center fsize150">)</td>
<td class="center"><sup>1.3</sup></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="center">&nbsp;V<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>in which P is the atmospheric pressure; P<sup>1</sup> is the final
pressure, and V/V<sup>1</sup> is the compression ratio, therefore P<sup>1</sup> =
14.7&nbsp;(4.5)<sup>1.3</sup> = 104 pounds per square inch, absolute.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is, 104 pounds per square inch is the most efficient
final compression pressure to have for this engine
at sea level, since it comes directly from the compression
ratio.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now supposing we consider that the altitude is 7,000<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
feet above sea level. At this height the atmospheric pressure
is 11.25 pounds per square inch, approximately. In
this case we can again substitute in the formula, using
the new atmospheric pressure figure. The equation becomes:</p>

<p>
P<sup>1</sup> = 11.25&nbsp;(4.5)<sup>1.3</sup>&mdash;79.4 pounds per square inch, absolute.
</p>

<p>&#8220;Therefore we now have a final compression pressure
of only 79.4 pounds per square inch, which is considerably
below the pressure we have just found to be the most
efficient for the motor. The resulting power drop is evident.</p>

<p>&#8220;It should be borne in mind that these final compression
pressures are absolute pressures&mdash;that is, they include
the atmospheric pressure. In the first case, to get
the pressure above atmospheric you would subtract 14.7
and in the latter 11.25 would have to be deducted. In
other words, where the sea level compression is 89.3 pounds
per square inch above the atmosphere, the same motor
will have only a compression pressure of 68.15 pounds
per square inch above the atmosphere at 7,000 feet elevation.</p>

<p>&#8220;From the above it is evident that in order to bring
the final compression pressure up to the efficient figure
we have determined, a different compression ratio would
have to be used. That is, the final volume would have
to be less, and as it is impossible to vary this to meet
the conditions of altitude, the loss of power cannot be
helped except by the replacing of the standard pistons
with some that are longer above the wrist-pin so as to
reduce the space above the pistons when on top center.
Then if the ratio is thereby raised to some such figures
as 5 to 1, the engine will again have its proper final pressure,
but it will still not have as much power as it would
have at sea level, since the horse-power varies directly
with the atmospheric pressure, final compression being
kept constant. That is, at 7,000 feet the horse-power of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
an engine that had 40 horse-power at sea level would be
equal to</p>

<table class="formula" summary="Formula p 147">

<tr>
<td class="center bb">11.25</td>
<td rowspan="2" class="left">&nbsp;= 30.6 horse-power.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="center">14.7</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>&#8220;If the original compression ratio of 4.5 were retained,
the drop in horse-power would be even greater than this.
These computations and remarks will make it clear that
the designer who contemplates building an airplane for
high altitude use should see to it that it is of sufficient
power to compensate for the drop that is inevitable when
it is up in the air. This is often illustrated in stationary
gas-engine installations. An engine that had a sea-level
rating amply sufficient for the work required, might not
be powerful enough when brought up several thousand
feet.&#8221; When one considers that airplanes attain heights
of over 18,000 feet, it will be evident that an ample margin
of engine power is necessary.</p>

<h3><a name="SecV_23" id="SecV_23"></a>THE DIESEL SYSTEM</h3>

<p>A system of fuel supply developed by the late Dr.
Diesel, a German chemist and engineer, is attracting considerable
attention at the present time on account of the
ability of the Diesel engine to burn low-grade fuels, such
as crude petroleum. In this system the engines are built
so that very high compressions are used, and only pure
air is taken into the cylinder on the induction stroke.
This is compressed to a pressure of about 500 pounds
per square inch, and sufficient heat is produced by this
compression to explode a hydrocarbon mixture. As the
air which is compressed to this high point cannot burn,
the fuel is introduced into the cylinder combustion chamber
under still higher compression than that of the compressed
air, and as it is injected in a fine stream it is
immediately vaporized because of the heat. Just as soon
as the compressed air becomes thoroughly saturated with
the liquid fuel, it will explode on account of the degree of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
heat present in the combustion chamber. Such motors
have been used in marine and stationary applications, but
are not practical for airplanes or motor cars because of
lack of flexibility and great weight in proportion to power
developed. The Diesel engine is the standard power plant
used in submarine boats and motor ships, as its efficiency
renders it particularly well adapted for large units.</p>

<h3><a name="SecV_24" id="SecV_24"></a>NOTES ON CARBURETOR INSTALLATION IN AIRPLANES</h3>

<p>A writer in &#8220;The Aeroplane,&#8221; an English publication,
discourses on some features of carburetor installation that
may be of interest to the aviation student, so portions of
the dissertation are reproduced herewith.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Users of airplanes fitted with ordinary type carburetors will
do well to note carefully the way in which these are fitted, for
several costly machines have been burnt lately through the sheer
carelessness of their users. These particular machines were fitted
with a high powered V-type engine, made by a firm which is
famous as manufacturers of automobiles <i>de luxe</i>. In these engines
there are four carburetors, mounted in the V between the cylinders.
When the engine is fitted as a tractor, the float chambers are in
front of the jet chambers. Consequently, when the tail of the
machine is resting on the ground, the jets are lower than the level
of the gasoline in the float chamber.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite naturally, the gasoline runs out of the jet, if it is left
turned on when the machine is standing in its normal position,
and trickles into the V at the top of the crank-case. Thence it
runs down to the tail of the engine, where the magnetos are fitted,
and saturates them. If left long enough, the gasoline manages
to soak well into the fuselage before evaporating. And what does
evaporate makes an inflammable gas in the forward cockpit. Then
some one comes along and starts up the engine. The spark-gap
of the magneto gives one flash, and the whole front of the machine
proceeds to give a Fourth of July performance forthwith. Naturally,
one safeguard is to turn the petrol off directly the machine
lands. Another is never to turn it on till the engine is actually
being started up.</p>

<p>&#8220;One would be asking too much of the human boy&mdash;who is
officially regarded as the only person fit to fly an aeroplane&mdash;if
one depended upon his memory of such a detail to save his machine,
though one might perhaps reasonably expect the older pilots
to remember not to forget. Even so, other means of prevention<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
are preferable, for fire is quite as likely to occur from just the
same cause if the engine happens to be a trifle obstinate in starting,
and so gives the carburetors several minutes in which to drip&mdash;in
which operation they would probably be assisted by air-mechanics
&#8216;tickling&#8217; them.</p>

<p>&#8220;One way out of the trouble is to fit drip tins under the jet
chamber to catch the gasoline as it falls. This is all very well
just to prevent fire while the machine is being started up, but it
will not save it if it is left standing with the tail on the ground
and the petrol turned on, for the drip tins will then fill up and
run over. And if it catches then, the contents of the drip tins
merely add fuel to the fire.</p>

<h4><i>Reversing Carburetors</i></h4>

<p>&#8220;Yet another way is to turn the carburetors round, so that
the float chambers are behind the jets, and so come below them
when the tail is on the ground, thus cutting off the gasoline low
down in the jets. There seems to be no particular mechanical
difficulty about this, though I must confess that I did not note
very carefully whether the reversal of the float chambers would
make them foul any other fittings on the engine. It has been
argued, however, that doing this would starve the engine of gasoline
when climbing at a steep angle, as the gasoline would then
be lowered in the jets and need more suction to get into the
cylinders. This is rather a pretty point of amateur motor mechanics
to discuss, for, obviously, when the same engine is used
as a &#8216;pusher&#8217; instead of a tractor, the jets are in front of the
floats, and there seems to be no falling off in power.</p>

<h4><i>Starvation of Mixture</i></h4>

<p>&#8220;Moreover, the higher a machine goes the lower is the atmospheric
pressure, and, consequently, the less is the amount of air
sucked in at each induction stroke. This means, of course, that
with the gasoline supply the mixture at high altitudes is too
rich, so that, in order to get precisely the right mixture when very
high up, it is necessary to reduce the gasoline supply by screwing
down the needle valve between the tank and the carburetor&mdash;at
least, that has been the experience of various high-flying pilots.
No doubt something might be done in the way of forced air feed
to compensate for reduced atmospheric pressure, but it remains
to be proved whether the extra weight of mechanism involved
would pay for the extra power obtained. Variable compression
might do something, also, to even things up, but here, also, weight
of mechanism has to be considered.</p>

<p>&#8220;In any case, at present, the higher one goes the more the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
power of the engine is reduced, for less air means a less volume
of mixture per cylinder, and as the petrol feed has to be starved
to suit the smaller amount of air available, this means further loss
of power. I do not know whether anyone has evolved a carburetor
which automatically starves the gasoline feed when high up,
but it seems possible that when an airplane is sagging about &#8216;up
against the ceiling&#8217;&mdash;as a French pilot described the absolute
limit of climb for his particular machine&mdash;it might be a good
thing to have the jets in front of the float chamber, for then a
certain amount of automatic starvation would take place.</p>

<p>&#8220;When a machine is right up at its limiting height, and the
pilot is doing his best to make it go higher still, it is probably
flying with its tail as low as the pilot dares to let it go, and the
lateral and longitudinal controls are on the verge of vanishing,
so that if the carburetor jets are behind the float chambers there
is bound to be an over-rich mixture in any case. There is even
a possibility of a careless or ignorant pilot carrying on in this tail-down
position till one set of cylinders cuts out altogether, in which
case the carburetor feeding that set may flood over, just as if the
machine were on the ground, and the whole thing may catch fire.
Whereas, with the jets in front of the floats, though the mixture
may starve a trifle, there is, at any rate, no danger of fire through
climbing with the tail down.</p>

<h4><i>A Diving Danger</i></h4>

<p>&#8220;On the other hand, in a &#8216;pusher&#8217; with this type of engine,
if the jets are in their normal position&mdash;which is in front of the
floats&mdash;there is danger of fire in a dive. That is to say, if the
pilot throttles right down, or switches off and relies on air pressure
on his propeller to start the engine again, so that the gasoline
is flooding over out of the jets instead of being sucked into the
engine, there may be flooding over the magnetos if the dive is very
steep and prolonged. In any case, a long dive will mean a certain
amount of flooding, and, probably, a good deal of choking and
spitting by the engine before it gets rid of the over-rich mixture
and picks up steady firing again. Which may indicate to young
pilots that it is not good to come down too low under such circumstances,
trusting entirely to their engines to pick up at once
and get going before they hit the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the whole, it seems that it might be better practice to set
the carburetors thwartwise of engines, for then jets and floats
would always be at approximately the same level, no matter what
the longitudinal position of the machine, and it is never long
enough in one position at a big lateral angle to raise any serious
carburetor troubles. Car manufacturers who dive cheerfully into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the troubled waters of aero-engine designs are a trifle apt to forget
that their engines are put into positions on airplanes which
would be positively indecent in a motor car. An angle of 1 in 10
is the exception on a car, but it is common on an airplane, and
no one ever heard of a car going down a hill of 10 to 1&mdash;which is
not quite a vertical dive. Therefore, there is every excuse for a
well-designed and properly brought-up carburetor misbehaving
itself in an aeroplane.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems, then, that it is up to the manufacturers to produce
better carburetors&mdash;say, with the jet central with the float. But
it also behooves the user to show ordinary common sense in handling
the material at present available, and not to make a practice
of burning up $25,000 worth or so of airplane just because
he is too lazy to turn off his gasoline, or to have the tail of his
machine lifted up while he is tinkering with his engines.&#8221;</p></div>

<h3><a name="SecV_25" id="SecV_25"></a>NOTES ON CARBURETOR ADJUSTMENT</h3>

<p>The modern float feed carburetor is a delicate and
nicely balanced appliance that requires a certain amount
of attention and care in order to obtain the best results.
The adjustments can only be made by one possessing an
intelligent knowledge of carburetor construction and must
never be made unless the reason for changing the old adjustment
is understood. Before altering the adjustment
of the leading forms of carburetors, a few hints regarding
the quality to be obtained in the mixture should be given
some consideration, as if these are properly understood
this knowledge will prove of great assistance in adjusting
the vaporizer to give a good working proportion of fuel
and air. There is some question regarding the best mixture
proportions and it is estimated that gas will be
explosive in which the proportions of fuel vapor and air
will vary from one part of the former to a wide range
included between four and eighteen parts of the latter.
A one to four mixture is much too rich, while the one
in eighteen is much too lean to provide positive ignition.</p>

<p>A rich mixture should be avoided because the excessive
fuel used will deposit carbon and will soot the cylinder
walls, combustion chamber interior, piston top and valves
and also tend to overheat the motor. A rich mixture will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
also seriously interfere with flexible control of the engine,
as it will choke up on low throttle and run well on open
throttle when the full amount of gas is needed. A rich
mixture may be quickly discovered by black smoke issuing
from the muffler, the exhaust gas having a very pungent
odor. If the mixture contains a surplus of air there will
be popping sounds in the carburetor, which is commonly
termed &#8220;blowing back.&#8221; To adjust a carburetor is not
a difficult matter when the purpose of the various control
members is understood. The first thing to do in adjusting
a carburetor is to start the motor and to retard the sparking
lever so the motor will run slowly leaving the throttle
about half open. In order to ascertain if the mixture is
too rich cut down the gasoline flow gradually by screwing
down the needle valve until the motor commences to run
irregularly or misfire. Close the needle valves as far as
possible without having the engine come to a stop, and
after having found the minimum amount of fuel gradually
unscrew the adjusting valve until you arrive at the point
where the engine develops its highest speed. When this
adjustment is secured the lock nut is screwed in place so
the needle valve will keep the adjustment. The next point
to look out for is regulation of the auxiliary air supply on
those types of carburetors where an adjustable air valve
is provided. This is done by advancing the spark lever
and opening the throttle. The air valve is first opened
or the spring tension reduced to a point where the engine
misfires or pops back in the carburetor. When the point
of maximum air supply the engine will run on is thus determined,
the air valve spring may be tightened by screwing
in on the regulating screw until the point is reached
where an appreciable speeding up of the engine is noticed.
If both fuel and air valves are set right, it will be possible
to accelerate the engine speed uniformly without interfering
with regularity of engine operation by moving the
throttle lever or accelerator pedal from its closed to its
wide open position, this being done with the spark lever
advanced. All types of carburetors do not have the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
means of adjustment; in fact, some adjust only with the
gasoline regulating needle; others must have a complete
change of spray nozzles; while in others the mixture proportions
may be varied only by adjustment of the quantity
of entering air. Changing the float level is effective in
some carburetors, but this should never be done unless it
is certain that the level is not correct. Full instructions
for locating carburetion troubles will be given in proper
sequence.</p>

<p>It is a fact well known to experienced repairmen and
motorists that atmospheric conditions have much to do
with carburetor action. It is often observed that a motor
seems to develop more power at night than during the
day, a circumstance which is attributed to the presence of
more moisture in the cooler night air. Likewise, taking
a motor from sea level to an altitude of 10,000 feet involves
using rarefied air in the engine cylinders and atmospheric
pressures ranging from 14.7 pounds at sea
level to 10.1 pounds per square inch at the high altitude.
All carburetors will require some adjustment in the course
of any material change from one level to another. Great
changes of altitude also have a marked effect on the cooling
system of an airplane. Water boils at 212 degrees F.
only at sea level. At an altitude of 10,000 feet it will
boil at a temperature nineteen degrees lower, or 193 degrees
F.</p>

<p>In high altitudes the reduced atmospheric pressure,
for 5,000 feet or higher than sea level, results in not
enough air reaching the mixture, so that either the auxiliary
air opening has to be increased, or the gasoline in
the mixture cut down. If the user is to be continually
at high altitudes he should immediately purchase either
a larger dome or a smaller strangling tube, mentioning
the size carburetor that is at present in use and the type
of motor that it is on, including details as to the bore
and stroke. The smaller strangling tube makes an increased
suction at the spray nozzle; the air will have to
be readjusted to meet it and you can use more auxiliary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
air, which is necessary. The effect on the motor without
a smaller strangling tube is a perceptible sluggishness and
failure to speed up to its normal crank-shaft revolutions,
as well as failure to give power. It means that about one-third
of the regular speed is cut out. The reduced atmospheric
pressure reduces the power of the explosion,
in that there is not the same quantity of oxygen in the
combustion chamber as at sea level; to increase the amount
taken in, you must also increase the gasoline speed, which
is done by an increased suction through the smaller strangling
aperture. Some forms of carburetors are affected
more than others by changes of altitude, which explains
why the Zenith is so widely employed for airplane engine
use. The compensating nozzle construction is not influenced
as much by changes of altitude as the simpler nozzle
types are.</p>

<h3><a name="SecVI_1" id="SecVI_1"></a>EARLY IGNITION SYSTEMS</h3>

<p>One of the most important auxiliary groups of the
gasoline engine comprising the airplane power plant and
one absolutely necessary to insure engine action is the
ignition system or the method employed of kindling the
compressed gas in the cylinder to produce an explosion
and useful power. The ignition system has been fully
as well developed as other parts of the engine, and at
the present time practically all ignition systems follow
principles which have become standard through wide acceptance.</p>

<p>During the early stages of development of the gasoline
engine various methods of exploding the charge of combustible
gas in the cylinder were employed. On some of
the earliest engines a flame burned close to the cylinder
head, and at the proper time for ignition a slide or valve
moved to provide an opening which permitted the flame
to ignite the gas back of the piston. This system was
practical only on the primitive form of gas engines in
which the charge was not compressed before ignition.
Later, when it was found desirable to compress the gas
a certain degree before exploding it, an incandescent platinum
tube in the combustion chamber, which was kept
in a heated condition by a flame burning in it, exploded
the gas. The naked flame was not suitable in this application<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
because when the slide was opened to provide communication
between the flame and the gas the compressed
charge escaped from the cylinder with enough pressure to
blow out the flame at times and thus cause irregular ignition.
When the flame was housed in a platinum tube
it was protected from the direct action of the gas, and
as long as the tube was maintained at the proper point
of incandescence regular ignition was obtained.</p>

<p>Some engineers utilized the property of gases firing
themselves if compressed to a sufficient degree, while
others depended upon the heat stored in the cylinder-head
to fire the highly compressed gas. None of these methods
were practical in their application to motor car engines
because they did not permit flexible engine action which
is so desirable. At the present time, electrical ignition
systems in which the compressed gas is exploded by the
heating value of the minute electric arc or spark in the
cylinder are standard, and the general practice seems to
be toward the use of mechanical producers of electricity
rather than chemical batteries.</p>

<h3><a name="SecVI_2" id="SecVI_2"></a>ELECTRICAL IGNITION BEST</h3>

<p>Two general forms of electrical ignition systems may
be used, the most popular being that in which a current
of electricity under high tension is made to leap a gap
or air space between the points of the sparking plug
screwed into the cylinder. The other form, which has
been almost entirely abandoned in automobile and which
was never used with airplane engine practice, but which
is still used to some extent on marine engines, is called
the low-tension system because current of low voltage is
used and the spark is produced by moving electrodes in
the combustion chamber.</p>

<p>The essential elements of any electrical ignition system,
either high or low tension, are: First, a simple and
practical method of current production; second, suitable
timing apparatus to cause the spark to occur at the right
point in the cycle of engine action; third, suitable wiring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
and other apparatus to convey the current produced by
the generator to the sparking member in the cylinder.</p>

<p>The various appliances necessary to secure prompt ignition
of the compressed gases should be described in some
detail because of the importance of the ignition system.
It is patent that the scope of a work of this character
does not permit one to go fully into the theory and principles
of operation of all appliances which may be used
in connection with gasoline motor ignition, but at the same
time it is important that the elementary principles be
considered to some extent in order that the reader should
have a proper understanding of the very essential ignition
apparatus. The first point considered will be the common
methods of generating the electricity, then the appliances
to utilize it and produce the required spark in the cylinder.
Inasmuch as magneto ignition is universally used
in connection with airplane engine ignition it will not be
necessary to consider battery ignition systems.</p>

<h3><a name="SecVI_3" id="SecVI_3"></a>FUNDAMENTALS OF MAGNETISM OUTLINED</h3>

<p>To properly understand the phenomena and forces involved
in the generation of electrical energy by mechanical
means it is necessary to become familiar with some of the
elementary principles of magnetism and its relation to
electricity. The following matter can be read with profit
by those who are not familiar with the subject. Most
persons know that magnetism exists in certain substances,
but many are not able to grasp the terms used in describing
the operation of various electrical devices because of
not possessing a knowledge of the basic facts upon which
the action of such apparatus is based.</p>

<p>Magnetism is a property possessed by certain substances
and is manifested by the ability to attract and
repel other materials susceptible to its effects. When this
phenomenon is manifested by a conductor or wire through
which a current of electricity is flowing it is termed &#8220;electro-magnetism.&#8221;
Magnetism and electricity are closely
related, each being capable of producing the other. Practically<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
all of the phenomena manifested by materials which
possess magnetic qualities naturally can be easily reproduced
by passing a current of electricity through a body
which, when not under electrical influence, is not a magnetic
substance. Only certain substances show magnetic
properties, these being iron, nickel, cobalt and their alloys.</p>

<p>The earliest known substance possessing magnetic
properties was a stone first found in Asia Minor. It
was called the lodestone or leading stone, because of its
tendency, if arranged so it could be moved freely, of pointing
one particular portion toward the north. The compass
of the ancient Chinese mariners was a piece of this material,
now known to be iron ore, suspended by a light thread
or floated on a cork in some liquid so one end would point
toward the north magnetic pole of the earth. The reason
that this stone was magnetic was hard to define for a
time, until it was learned that the earth was one huge
magnet and that the iron ore, being particularly susceptible,
absorbed and retained some of this magnetism.</p>

<p>Most of us are familiar with some of the properties of
the magnet because of the extensive sale and use of small
horseshoe magnets as toys. As they only cost a few pennies
every one has owned one at some time or other and
has experimented with various materials to see if they
would be attracted. Small pieces of iron or steel were
quickly attracted to the magnet and adhered to the pole
pieces when brought within the zone of magnetic influence.
It was soon learned that brass, copper, tin or zinc were
not affected by the magnet. A simple experiment that
serves to illustrate magnetic attraction of several substances
is shown at A, <a href="#Fig057">Fig. 57</a>. In this, several balls are
hung from a standard or support, one of these being of
iron, another of steel. When a magnet is brought near
either of these they will be attracted toward it, while the
others will remain indifferent to the magnetic force.
Experimenters soon learned that of the common metals
only iron or steel were magnetic.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="Fig057" id="Fig057"></a>
<img src="images/illo154.png" alt="Fig. 57" width="400" height="521" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 57.&mdash;Some Simple Experiments to Demonstrate Various Magnetic Phenomena
and Clearly Outline Effects of Magnetism and Various Forms
of Magnets.</p></div>

<p>If the ordinary bar or horseshoe magnet be carefully<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
examined, one end will be found to be marked N. This
indicates the north pole, while the other end is not usually
marked and is the south pole. If the north pole of one
magnet is brought near the south pole of another, a strong
attraction will exist between them, this depending upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
the size of the magnets used and the air gap separating
the poles. If the south pole of one magnet is brought
close to the end of the same polarity of the other there
will be a pronounced repulsion of like force. These facts
are easily proved by the simple experiment outlined at
B, <a href="#Fig057">Fig. 57</a>. A magnet will only attract or influence a
substance having similar qualities. The like poles of
magnets will repel each other because of the obvious impossibility
of uniting two influences or forces of practically
equal strength but flowing in opposite directions.
The unlike poles of magnets attract each other because
the force is flowing in the same direction. The flow of
magnetism is through the magnet from south to north and
the circuit is completed by the flow of magnetic influence
through the air gap or metal armature bridging it from
the north to the south pole.</p>

<h3><a name="SecVI_4" id="SecVI_4"></a><a name="SecVI_5" id="SecVI_5"></a>FORMS OF MAGNETS AND ZONE OF MAGNETIC INFLUENCE
DEFINED</h3>

<p>Magnets are commonly made in two forms, either in
the shape of a bar or horseshoe. These two forms are
made in two types, simple or compound. The latter are
composed of a number of magnets of the same form united
so the ends of like polarity are laced together, and such
a construction will be more efficient and have more strength
than a simple magnet of the same weight. The two common
forms of simple and compound magnets are shown
at C, <a href="#Fig057">Fig. 57</a>. The zone in which a magnetic influence
occurs is called the magnetic field, and this force can be
graphically shown by means of imaginary lines, which
are termed &#8220;lines of force.&#8221; As will be seen from the
diagram at D, <a href="#Fig057">Fig. 57</a>, the lines show the direction of
action of the magnetic force and also show its strength,
as they are closer together and more numerous when the
intensity of the magnetic field is at its maximum. A
simple method of demonstrating the presence of the force
is to lay a piece of thin paper over the pole pieces of either
a bar or horseshoe magnet and sprinkle fine iron filings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
on it. The particles of metal arrange themselves in very
much the manner shown in the illustrations and prove
that the magnetic field actually exists.</p>

<p>The form of magnet used will materially affect the
size and area of the magnetic field. It will be noted that
the field will be concentrated to a greater extent with
the horseshoe form because of the proximity of the poles.
It should be understood that these lines have no actual
existence, but are imaginary and assumed to exist only
to show the way the magnetic field is distributed. The
magnetic influence is always greater at the poles than
at the center, and that is why a horseshoe or U-form
magnet is used in practically all magnetos or dynamos.
This greater attraction at the poles can be clearly demonstrated
by sprinkling iron filings on bar and U magnets,
as outlined at E, <a href="#Fig057">Fig. 57</a>. A large mass gathers at
the pole pieces, gradually tapering down toward the point
where the attraction is least.</p>

<p>From the diagrams it will be seen that the flow of
magnetism is from one pole to the other by means of
curved paths between them. This circuit is completed
by the magnetism flowing from one pole to the other
through the magnet, and as this flow is continued as long
as the body remains magnetic it constitutes a magnetic
circuit. If this flow were temporarily interrupted by
means of a conductor of electricity moving through the
field there would be a current of electricity induced in
the conductor every time it cut the lines of force. There
are three kinds of magnetic circuits. A non-magnetic
circuit is one in which the magnetic influence completes
its circuit through some substance not susceptible to the
force. A closed magnetic circuit is one in which the influence
completes its circuit through some magnetic material
which bridges the gap between the poles. A compound
circuit is that in which the magnetic influence
passes through magnetic substances and non-magnetic substances
in order to complete its circuit.</p>

<p class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></p>

<h3><a name="SecVI_6" id="SecVI_6"></a>HOW IRON AND STEEL BARS ARE MADE MAGNETIC</h3>

<p>Magnetism may be produced in two ways, by contact
or induction. If a piece of steel is rubbed on a magnet
it will be found a magnet when removed, having a north
and south pole and all of the properties found in the
energizing magnet. This is magnetizing by contact. A
piece of steel will retain the magnetism imparted to it for
a considerable length of time, and the influence that remains
is known as residual magnetism. This property
may be increased by alloying the steel with tungsten and
hardening it before it is magnetized. Any material that
will retain its magnetic influence after removal from the
source of magnetism is known as a permanent magnet.
If a piece of iron or steel is brought into the magnetic
field of a powerful magnet it becomes a magnet without
actual contact with the energizer. This is magnetizing
by magnetic induction. If a powerful electric current
flows through an insulated conductor wound around a
piece of iron or steel it will make a magnet of it. This
is magnetizing by electro-magnetic induction. A magnet
made in this manner is termed an electro-magnet and
usually the metal is of such a nature that it will not
retain its magnetism when the current ceases to flow
around it. Steel is used in all cases where permanent
magnets are required, while soft iron is employed in all
cases where an intermittent magnetic action is desired.
Magneto field magnets are always made of tungsten steel
alloy, so treated that it will retain its magnetism for
lengthy periods.</p>

<h3><a name="SecVI_7" id="SecVI_7"></a>ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM CLOSELY RELATED</h3>

<p>There are many points in which magnetism and electricity
are alike. For instance, air is a medium that offers
considerable resistance to the passage of both magnetic
influence and electric energy, although it offers more
resistance to the passage of the latter. Minerals like
iron or steel are very easily influenced by magnetism and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
easily penetrated by it. When one of these is present
in the magnetic circuit the magnetism will flow through
the metal. Any metal is a good conductor for the passage
of the electric current, but few metals are good
conductors of magnetic energy. A body of the proper
metal will become a magnet due to induction if placed
in the magnetic field, having a south pole where the lines
of force enter it and a north pole where they pass out.</p>

<p>We have seen that a magnet is constantly surrounded
by a magnetic field and that an electrical conductor when
carrying a current is also surrounded by a field of magnetic
influence. Now if the conductor carrying a current
of electricity will induce magnetism in a bar of iron or
steel, by a reversal of this process, a magnetized iron or
steel bar will produce a current of electricity in a conductor.
It is upon this principle that the modern dynamo
or magneto is constructed. If an electro-motive force is
induced in a conductor by moving it across a field of magnetic
influence, or by passing a magnetic field near a
conductor, electricity is said to be generated by magneto-electric
induction. All mechanical generators of the electric
current using permanent steel magnets to produce a
field of magnetic influence are of this type.</p>

<h3><a name="SecVI_8" id="SecVI_8"></a>BASIC PRINCIPLES OF MAGNETO OUTLINED</h3>

<p>The accompanying diagram, <a href="#Fig058">Fig. 58</a>, will show these
principles very clearly. As stated on an earlier page,
if the lines of force in the magnetic field are cut by a
suitable conductor an electrical impulse will be produced
in that conductor. In this simple machine the lines of
force exist between the poles of a horseshoe magnet. The
conductor, which in this case is a loop of copper wire,
is mounted upon a spindle in order that it may be rotated
in the magnetic field to cut the lines of magnetic influence
present between the pole pieces. Both of the ends
of this loop are connected, one with the insulated drum
shown upon the shaft, the other to the shaft. Two metal
brushes are employed to collect the current and cause it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
to flow through the external circuit. It can be seen that
when the shaft is turned in the direction of the arrow
the loop will cut through the lines of magnetic influence
and a current will be generated therein.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="Fig058" id="Fig058"></a>
<img src="images/illo159.png" alt="Fig. 58" width="450" height="462" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 58.&mdash;Elementary Form of Magneto Showing Principal Parts Simplified
to Make Method of Current Generation Clear.</p></div>

<p>The pressure of the current and the amount produced
vary in accordance to the rapidity with which the lines
of magnetic influence are cut. The armature of a practical
magneto, therefore, differs materially from that shown
in the diagram. A large number of loops of wire would
be mounted upon this shaft in order that the lines of
magnetic influence would be cut a greater number of times
in a given period and a core of iron used as a backing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
for the wire. This would give a more rapid alternating
current and a higher electro-motive force than would be
the case with a smaller number of loops of wire.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="Fig059" id="Fig059"></a>
<img src="images/illo160.png" alt="Fig. 59" width="400" height="554" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 59.&mdash;Showing How Strength of Magnetic Influence and of the Currents
Induced in the Windings of Armature Vary with the Rapidity of
Changes of Flow.</p></div>

<p>The illustrations at <a href="#Fig059">Fig. 59</a> show a
conventional double<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
winding armature and field magnetic of a practical magneto
in part section and will serve to more fully emphasize
the points previously made. If the armature or
spindle were removed from between the pole pieces there
would exist a field of magnetic influence as shown at <a href="#Fig057">Fig.
57</a>, but the introduction of this component provides a
conductor (the iron core) for the magnetic energy, regardless
of its position, though the facility with which
the influence will be transmitted depends entirely upon
the position of the core. As shown at A, the magnetic
flow is through the main body in a straight line, while
at B, which position the armature has attained after one-eighth
revolution, or 45 degrees travel in the direction
of the arrow, the magnetism must pass through in the
manner indicated. At C, which position is attained every
half revolution, the magnetic energy abandons the longer
path through the body of the core for the shorter passage
offered by the side pieces, and the field thrown out by the
cross bar disappears. On further rotation of the armature,
as at D, the body of the core again becomes energized
as the magnetic influence resumes its flow through
it. These changes in the strength of the magnetic field
when distorted by the armature core, as well as the intensity
of the energy existing in the field, affect the
windings, and the electrical energy induced therein corresponds
in strength to the rapidity with which these
changes in magnetic flow occur. The most pronounced
changes in the strength of the field will occur as the armature
passes from position B to D, because the magnetic
field existing around the core will be destroyed and again
re-established.</p>

<p>During the most of the armature rotation the changes
in strength will be slight and the currents induced in the
wire correspondingly small; but at the instant the core
becomes remagnetized, as the armature leaves position C,
the current produced will be at its maximum, and it is necessary
to so time the rotation of the armature that at this
instant one of the cylinders is in condition to be fired. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
is imperative that the armature be driven in such relation
to the crank-shaft that each production of maximum current
coincides with the ignition point, this condition existing
twice during each revolution of the armature, or at
every 180 degrees travel. Each position shown corresponds
to 45 degrees travel of the armature, or one-eighth
of a turn, and it takes just three-eighths revolution to
change the position from A to that shown at D.</p>

<h3><a name="SecVI_9" id="SecVI_9"></a>ESSENTIAL PARTS OF A MAGNETO AND THEIR FUNCTIONS</h3>

<p>The magnets which produce the influence that in turn
induces the electrical energy in the winding or loops of
wire on the armature, and which may have any even
number of opposed poles, are called field magnets. The
loops of wire which are mounted upon a suitable drum
and rotate in the field of magnetic influence in order to
cut the lines of force is called an armature winding, while
the core is the metal portion. The entire assembly is
called the armature. The exposed ends of the magnets
are called pole pieces and the arrangement used to collect
the current is either a commutator or a collector. The
stationary pieces which bear against the collector or commutator
and act as terminals for the outside circuit are
called brushes. These brushes are often of copper, or
some of its alloys, because copper has a greater electrical
conductivity than any other metal.</p>

<p>These brushes are nearly always of carbon, which
is sometimes electroplated with copper to increase its
electrical conductivity, though cylinders of copper wire
gauze impregnated with graphite are utilized at times.
Carbon is used because it is not so liable to cut the metal
of the commutator as might be the case if the contact was
of the metal to metal type. The reason for this is that
carbon has the peculiar property in that it materially assists
in the lubrication of the commutator, and being of
soft, unctuous composition, will wear and conform to any
irregularities on the surface of the metal collector rings.</p>

<p>The magneto in common use consists of a number of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
horseshoe magnets which are compound in form and attached
to suitable cast-iron pole pieces used to collect and
concentrate the magnetic influence of the various magnets.
Between these pole pieces an armature rotates. This is
usually shaped like a shuttle, around which are wound
coils of insulated wire. These are composed of a large
number of turns and the current produced depends in
great measure upon the size of the wire and the number
of turns per coil. An armature winding of large wire will
deliver a current of great amperage, but of small voltage.
An armature wound with very fine wire will deliver a
current of high voltage but of low amperage. In the
ordinary form of magneto, such as used for ignition, the
current is alternating in character and the break in the
circuit should be timed to occur when the armature is at
the point of its greatest potential or pressure. Where
such a generator is designed for direct current production
the ends of the winding are attached to the segments of
a commutator, but where the instrument is designed to
deliver an alternating current one end of the winding is
fastened to an insulator ring on one end of the armature
shaft and the other end is grounded on the frame of the
machine.</p>

<p>The quantity of the current depends upon the strength
of the magnetic field and the number of lines of magnetic
influence acting through the armature. The electro-motive
force varies as to the length of the armature winding and
the number of revolutions at which the armature is rotated.</p>

<h3><a name="SecVI_10" id="SecVI_10"></a>THE TRANSFORMER SYSTEM USES LOW VOLTAGE MAGNETO</h3>

<p>The magneto in the various systems which employ a
transformer coil is very similar to a low-tension generator
in general construction, and the current delivered at
the terminals seldom exceeds 100 volts. As it requires
many times that potential or pressure to leap the gap
which exists between the points of the conventional spark
plug, a separate coil is placed in circuit to intensify the
current to one of greater capacity. The essential parts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
of such a system and their relation to each other are
shown in diagrammatic form at <a href="#Fig060">Fig. 60</a> and as a complete
system at <a href="#Fig061">Fig. 61</a>. As is true of other systems the
magnetic influence is produced by permanent steel magnets
clamped to the cast-iron pole pieces between which
the armature rotates. At the point of greatest potential
in the armature winding the current is broken by the
contact breaker, which is actuated by a cam, and a current
of higher value is induced in the secondary winding
of the transformer coil when the low voltage current is
passed through the primary winding.</p>

Arrangement of Interruptor and Distributor Mechanism.</p></div>

<p>It will be noted that the points of the contact breaker
are together except for the brief instant when separated
by the action of the point of the cam upon the lever. It
is obvious that the armature winding is short-circuited<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a></span>
upon itself except when the contact points are separated.
While the armature winding is thus short-circuited there
will be practically no generation of current. When the
points are separated there is a sudden flow of current
through the primary winding of the transformer coil, inducing
a secondary current in the other winding, which
can be varied in strength by certain considerations in the
preliminary design of the apparatus. This current of
higher potential or voltage is conducted directly to the
plug if the device is fitted to a single-cylinder engine, or
to the distributor arm if fitted to a multiple-cylinder motor.
The distributor consists of an insulator in which is
placed a number of segments, one for each cylinder to
be fired, and so spaced that the number of degrees between
them correspond to the ignition points of the motor.
A two-cylinder motor would have two segments, a three-cylinder,
three segments, and so on within the capacity
of the instrument. In the illustration a four-cylinder distributor
is fitted, and the distributing arm is in contact<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
with the segment corresponding to the cylinder about to
be fired.</p>

<h3><a name="SecVI_11" id="SecVI_11"></a>TRUE HIGH-TENSION MAGNETOS ARE SELF-CONTAINED</h3>

<p>The true high-tension magneto differs from the preceding
inasmuch as the current of high voltage is produced
in the armature winding direct, without the use of
the separate coil. Instead of but one coil, the armature
carries two, one of comparatively coarse wire, the other
of many turns of finer wire. The arrangement of these
windings can be readily ascertained by reference to the
diagram B, <a href="#Fig060">Fig. 60</a>, which shows the principle of operation
very clearly. The simplicity of the ignition system
is evident by inspection of <a href="#Fig062">Fig. 62</a>. One end of the
primary winding (coarse wire) is coupled or grounded
to the armature core, and the other passes to the insulated
part of the interrupter. While in some forms the
interrupter or contact breaker mechanism does not revolve,
the desired motion being imparted to the contact
lever to separate the points of a revolving cam, in this
the cam or tripping mechanism is stationary and the contact
breaker revolves. This arrangement makes it possible
to conduct the current from the revolving primary
coil to the interrupter by a direct connection, eliminating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
the use of brushes, which would otherwise be necessary.
In other forms of this appliance where the winding is
stationary, the interrupter may be operated by a revolving
cam, though, if desired, the used of a brush at this
point will permit this construction with a revolving
winding.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="Fig062" id="Fig062"></a>
<img src="images/illo167.png" alt="Fig. 62" width="500" height="253" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 62.&mdash;Berling Double-Spark Independent System.</p></div>

<p>During the revolution of the armature the grounded
lever makes and breaks contact with the insulated point,
short-circuiting the primary winding upon itself until the
armature reaches the proper position of maximum intensity
of current production, at which time the circuit is
broken, as in the former instance. One end of the secondary
winding (fine wire) is grounded on the live end of
the primary, the other end being attached to the revolving
arm of the distributor mechanism. So long as a closed
circuit is maintained feeble currents will pass through the
primary winding, and so long as the contact points are
together this condition will exist. When the current
reaches its maximum value, because of the armature being
in the best position, the cam operates the interrupter
and the points are separated, breaking the short circuit
which has existed in the primary winding.</p>

<p>The secondary circuit has been open while the distributor
arm has moved from one contact to another and there
has been no flow of energy through this winding. While
the electrical pressure will rise in this, even if the distributor
arm contacted with one of the segments, there
would be no spark at the plug until the contact points
separated, because the current in the secondary winding
would not be of sufficient strength. When the interrupter
operates, however, the maximum primary current will be
diverted from its short circuit and can flow to the ground
only through the secondary winding and spark-plug circuit.
The high pressure now existing in the secondary
winding will be greatly increased by the sudden flow of
primary current, and energy of high enough potential to
successfully bridge the gap at the plug is thereby produced
in the winding.</p>

<h3><a name="SecVI_12" id="SecVI_12"></a>THE BERLING MAGNETO</h3>

<p>The Berling magneto is a true high tension type delivering
two impulses per revolution, but it is made in a
variety of forms, both single and double spark. Its principle
of action does not differ in essentials from the high
tension type previously described. This magneto is used
on Curtiss aviation engines and will deliver sparks in a
positive manner sufficient to insure ignition of engines up
to 200 horse-power and at rotative speeds of the magneto
armature up to 4,000 r. p. m. which is sufficient to take
care of an eight-cylinder V engine running up to 2,000<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
r. p. m. The magneto is driven at crank-shaft speed on
four-cylinder engines, at 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> times crank-shaft speed on six-cylinder
engines and at twice crank-shaft speed on eight-cylinder
V types. The types &#8220;D&#8221; and &#8220;DD&#8221; BERLING
Magnetos are interchangeable with corresponding
magnetos of other standard makes. The dimensions of
the four-, six- and eight-cylinder types &#8220;D&#8221; and &#8220;DD&#8221;
are all the same.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="Fig063" id="Fig063"></a>
<img src="images/illo169.jpg" alt="Fig. 63" width="450" height="447" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 63.&mdash;Type DD Berling High Tension Magneto.</p></div>

<p>The ideal method of driving the magneto is by means
of flexible direct connecting coupling to a shaft intended
for the purpose of driving the magneto. As the magneto
must be driven at a high speed, a coupling of some
flexibility is preferable. The employment of such a coupling
will facilitate the mounting of the magneto, because
a small inaccuracy in the lining up of the magneto with
the driving shaft will be taken care of by the flexible
coupling, whereas with a perfectly rigid coupling the
line-up of the magneto must be absolutely accurate. Another
advantage of the flexible coupling is that the vibration
of the motor will not be as fully transmitted to the
armature shaft on the magneto as in case a rigid coupling
is used. This means prolonged life for the magneto.</p>

<p>The next best method of driving the magneto is by
means of a gear keyed to the armature shaft. When
this method of driving is employed, great care must be
exercised in providing sufficient clearance between the
gear on the magneto and the driving gear. If there
should be a tight spot between these two gears it will
react disadvantageously on the magneto. The third
available method is to drive the magneto by means of
a chain. This is the least desirable of the three methods
and should be resorted to only in case of absolute necessity.
It is difficult to provide sufficient clearance when
using a chain without rendering the timing less accurate
and positive.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="Fig064" id="Fig064"></a>
<img src="images/illo171.png" alt="Fig. 64" width="450" height="481" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 64.&mdash;Wiring Diagrams of Berling Magneto Ignition Systems.</p></div>

<p><a href="#Fig064">Fig. 64</a>, A shows diagrammatically the circuit of the
&#8220;D&#8221; type two-spark independent magneto and the switch
used with it. In position OFF the primary winding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
of the magneto is short-circuited and in this position
the switch serves as an ordinary cut-out or grounding
switch. In position &#8220;1&#8221; the switch connects the magneto
in such a way that it operates as an ordinary
single-spark magneto. In this position one end of the
secondary winding is grounded to the body of the motor.
This is the starting position. In this position of the
switch the entire voltage generated in the magneto is
concentrated at one spark-plug instead of being divided
in half. With the motor turning over very slowly, as is
the case in starting, the full voltage generated by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
magneto will not in all cases be sufficient to bridge simultaneously
two spark gaps, but is amply sufficient to
bridge one. Also, this position of the switch tends to
retard the ignition and should be used in starting to
prevent back-firing. With the switch in position &#8220;2&#8221;
the magneto applies ignition to both plugs in each
cylinder simultaneously. This is the normal running
position.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig064">Fig. 64</a>, B shows diagrammatically the circuit of the
type &#8220;DD&#8221; BERLING high-tension two-spark dual magneto.
This type is recommended for certain types of
heavy-duty airplane motors, which it is impossible to turn
over fast enough to give the magneto sufficient speed to
generate even a single spark of volume great enough to
ignite the gas in the cylinder. The dual feature consists
of the addition to the magneto of a battery interrupter.
The equipment consists of the magneto, coil and special
high-tension switch. The coil is intended to operate on
six volts. Either a storage battery or dry cells may be
used.</p>

<p>With the switch in the OFF position, the magneto is
grounded, and the battery circuit is open. With the
switch in the second or battery position marked &#8220;BAT,&#8221;
one end of the secondary winding of the magneto is
grounded, and the magneto operates as a single-spark
magneto delivering high-tension current to the inside
distributor, and the battery circuit being closed the high-tension
current from the coil is delivered to the outside
distributor. In this position the battery current is supplied
to one set of spark plugs, no matter how slowly
the motor is turned over, but as soon as the motor starts,
the magneto supplies current as a single-spark magneto
to the other set of the spark-plugs. After the engine is
running, the switch should be thrown to the position
marked &#8220;MAG.&#8221; The battery and coil are then disconnected,
and the magneto furnishes ignition to both
plugs in each cylinder. This is the normal running
position. Either a non-vibrating coil type &#8220;N-1&#8221; is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
furnished or a combined vibrating and non-vibrating coil
type &#8220;VN-1.&#8221;</p>

<h3><a name="SecVI_13a" id="SecVI_13a"></a>SETTING BERLING MAGNETO</h3>

<p>The magneto may be set according to one of two
different methods, the selection of which is, to some
extent, governed by the characteristics of the engine,
but largely due to the personal preference on the part
of the user. In the first method described below, the
most advantageous position of the piston for fully advanced
ignition is determined in relation to the extreme
advanced position of the magneto. In this case, the
fully retarded ignition will not be a matter of selection,
but the timing range of the magneto is wide enough to
bring the fully retarded ignition after top-center position
of the piston. The second method for the setting of the
magneto fixes the fully retarded position of the magneto
in relation to that position of the piston where fully
retarded ignition is desired. In this case, the extreme
advance position of the magneto will not always correspond
with the best position of the piston for fully advanced
ignition, and the amount of advance the magneto
should have to meet ideal requirements in this respect
must be determined by experiment.</p>

<h4><i>First Method:</i></h4>

<p>1. Designate one cylinder as cylinder No. 1.</p>

<p>2. Turn the crank-shaft until the piston in cylinder
No. 1 is in the position where the fully advanced spark
is desired to occur.</p>

<p>3. Remove the cover from the distributor block and
turn the armature shaft in the direction of rotation of the
magneto until the distributor finger-brush comes into
such a position that this brush makes contact with the
segment which is connected to the cable terminal marked
&#8220;1.&#8221; This is either one of the two bottom segments,
depending upon the direction of rotation.</p>

<p>4. Place the cam housing in extreme advance, i.e.,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
turn the cam housing until it stops, in the direction
opposite to the direction of rotation of the armature.
With the cam housing in this position, open the cover.</p>

<p>5. With the armature in the approximate position as
described in &#8220;3,&#8221; turn the armature slightly in either
direction to such a point that the platinum points of the
magneto interrupter will just begin to open at the end
of the cam, adjacent to the fibre lever on the interrupter.</p>

<p>6. With this exact position of the armature, fix the
magneto to the driving member of the engine.</p>

<h4><i>Second Method:</i></h4>

<p>1. Designate one cylinder as cylinder No. 1.</p>

<p>2. Turn the crank-shaft until the piston in cylinder
No. 1 is in the position at which the fully retarded spark
is desired to occur.</p>

<p>3. Same as No. 3 under First Method.</p>

<p>4. Place the cam housing in extreme retard, i.e., turn
the cam housing until it stops, in the same direction as
the direction of rotation of the armature. With the cam
housing in this position, open the cover.</p>

<p>5. Same as No. 5 under First Method.</p>

<p>6. Same as No. 6 under First Method.</p>

<h3>WIRING THE MAGNETO</h3>

<p>The wiring of the magneto is clearly shown by <a href="#Fig064">wiring
diagram</a>.</p>

<p>First determine the sequence of firing for the cylinders
and then connect the cables to the spark plug in the
cylinders in proper sequence, beginning with cylinder
No. 1 marked on the distributor block.</p>

<p>The switch used with the independent type must be
mounted in such a manner that there will be a metallic
connection between the frame of the magneto and the
metal portion of the switch.</p>

<p>It is advisable to use a separate battery, either storage
or dry cells, as a source of current for the dual equipment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
Connecting to the same battery that is used with
the generator and other electrical equipment may cause
trouble, as a &#8220;ground&#8221; in this battery causes the coil
to overheat.</p>

<h3><a name="SecVI_13b" id="SecVI_13b"></a>CARE AND MAINTENANCE</h3>

<h4><i>Lubrication:</i></h4>

<p>Use only the very best of oil for the oil cups.</p>

<p>Put five drops of oil in the oil cup at the driving end
of the magneto for every fifty hours of actual running.</p>

<p>Put five drops of oil in the oil cup at the interrupter
end of the magneto, located at one side of the cam
housing, for every hundred hours of actual running.</p>

<p>Lubricate the embossed cams in the cam housing with
a thin film of vaseline every fifty hours of actual running.
Wipe off all superfluous vaseline. Never use oil
in the interrupter. Do not lubricate any other part of
the interrupter.</p>

<h4><i>Adjusting the Interrupter:</i></h4>

<p>With the fibre lever in the center of one of the embossed
cams, as at <a href="#Fig065">Fig. 65</a>, the opening between the
platinum contacts should be not less than <span class="nowrap">.016&#8242;&#8242;</span> and not
more than <span class="nowrap">.020&#8242;&#8242;.</span> The gauge riveted to the adjusting
wrench should barely be able to pass between the contacts
when fully open. The platinum contacts must be
smoothed off with a very fine file. When in closed position,
the platinum contacts should make contact with
each other over their entire surfaces.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="Fig065" id="Fig065"></a>
<img src="images/illo176.png" alt="Fig. 65" width="400" height="257" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 65.&mdash;The Berling Magneto Breaker Box Showing Contact Points
Separated and Interruptor Lever on Cam.</p></div>

<p>When inspecting the interrupter, make sure that the
ground brush in the back of the interrupter base is
making good contact with the surface on which it rubs.</p>

<h4><i>Cleaning the Distributor:</i></h4>

<p>The distributor block cover should be removed for
inspection every twenty-five hours of actual running
and the carbon deposit from the distributor finger-brush
wiped off the distributor block by rubbing with a rag<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
or piece of waste dipped in gasoline or kerosene. The
high-tension terminal brush on the side of the magneto
should also be carefully inspected for proper tension.</p>

<h3>LOCATING TROUBLE</h3>

<p>Trouble in the ignition system is indicated by the
motor &#8220;missing,&#8221; stopping entirely, or by inability to
start.</p>

<p>It is safe to assume that the trouble is not in the
magneto, and the carburetor, gasoline supply and spark-plugs
should first be investigated.</p>

<p>If the magneto is suspected, the first thing to do is
to determine if it will deliver a spark. To determine
this, disconnect one of the high-tension leads from the
spark-plug in one of the cylinders and place it so that
there is approximately <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub>&#8242;&#8242;</span> between the terminal and
the cylinder frame.</p>

<p>Open the pet cocks on the other cylinders to prevent
the engine from firing and turn over the engine until
the piston is approaching the end of the compression<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
stroke in the cylinder from which the cable has been
removed. Set the magneto in the advance position and
rapidly rock the engine over the top-center position,
observing closely if a spark occurs between the end of
the high-tension cable and the frame.</p>

<p>If the magneto is of the dual type, the trouble may
be either in the magneto or in the battery or coil system,
therefore disconnect the battery and place the switch
in the position marked &#8220;MAG.&#8221; The magneto will then
operate as an independent magneto and should spark
in the proper manner. After this the battery system
should be investigated. To test the operation of the
battery and coil, examine all connections, making sure
that they are clean and tight, and then with the switch,
in the &#8220;BAT,&#8221; rock the piston slowly back and forth.
If a type &#8220;VN-1&#8221; coil is used, a shower of sparks should
jump between the high-tension cable terminal and the
cylinder frame when the piston is in the correct position
for firing. If no spark occurs, remove the cover from
the coil and see that the vibrating tongue is free. If a
type &#8220;N-1&#8221; coil is used, a single spark will occur. The
battery should furnish six volts when connected to the
coil, and this should also be verified.</p>

<p>If the coil still refuses to give a spark and all connections
are correct, the coil should be replaced and the
defective coil returned to the manufacturer.</p>

<p>If both magneto and coil give a spark when tested
as just described, the spark-plugs should be investigated.
To do this, disconnect the cables and remove
the spark-plugs. Then reconnect the cables to the plugs
and place them so that the frame portions of the plugs
are in metallic connection with the frame of the motor.
Then turn over the motor, thus revolving the magneto
armature, and see if a spark is produced at the spark
gaps of the plugs.</p>

<p>The most common defects in spark-plugs are breaking
down of the insulation, fouling due to carbon, or too large
or small a spark gap. To clean the plugs a stiff brush<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
and gasoline should be used. The spark gap should be
about <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>32</sub>&#8242;&#8242;</span>
and never less than <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>64</sub>&#8242;&#8242;</span>. Too small a gap
may have been caused by beads of metal forming due
to the heat of the spark. Too long a gap may have been
caused by the points burning off.</p>

<p>If the magneto and spark plugs are in good condition
and the engine does not run satisfactorily, the setting
should be verified according to instructions previously
given, and, if necessary, readjusted.</p>

<p>Be careful to observe that both the type &#8220;VN-1&#8221; and
type &#8220;N-1&#8221; coils are so arranged that the spark occurs
on the opening of the contacts of the timer. As this is
just the reverse of the usual operation, it should be carefully
noted when any change in the setting of the timer
is made. The timer on the dual type magneto is adjusted
so that the battery spark occurs about <span class="nowrap">5&deg;</span>
later<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
than the magneto spark. This provides an automatic
advance as soon as the switch is thrown to the magneto
position &#8220;MAG.&#8221; This relative timing can be easily
adjusted by removing the interrupter and shifting the
cam in the direction desired.</p>

<h3><a name="SecVI_14" id="SecVI_14"></a>THE DIXIE MAGNETO</h3>

<p>The Dixie magneto, shown at <a href="#Fig066">Fig. 66</a>, operates on a
different principle than the rotary armature type. It is
used on the Hall-Scott and other aviation engines. In
this magneto the rotating member consists of two pieces
of magnetic material separated by a non-magnetic center
piece. This member constitutes true rotating poles for
the magnet and rotates in a field structure, composed of
two laminated field pieces, riveted between two non-magnetic
rings. The bearings for the rotating poles are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
mounted in steel plates, which lie against the poles of the
magnets. When the magnet poles rotate, the magnetic
lines of force from each magnet pole are carried directly
to the field pieces and through the windings, without
reversal through the mass of the rotating member and
with only a single air gap. There are no losses by flux
reversal in the rotating part, such as take place in other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
machines, and this is said to account for the high efficiency
of the instrument.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 68.&mdash;The Rotating Elements of the Dixie Magneto.</p></div>

<p>And this &#8220;Mason Principle&#8221; involved in the operation
of the Dixie is simplified by a glance at the field structure,
consisting of the non-magnetic rings, assembled to
which are the field pieces between which the rotating
poles revolve (see <a href="#Fig068">Fig. 68</a>). Rotating between the
limbs of the magnets, these two pieces of magnetic material
form true extensions to the poles of the magnets,
and are, in consequence, <i>always</i> of the <i>same</i> polarity.
It will be seen there is no reversal of the magnetism
through them, and consequently no eddy current or hysteresis
losses which are present in the usual rotor or
inductor types. The simplicity features of construction
stand out prominently here, in that there are no revolving
windings, a detail entirely differing from the orthodox
high-tension instrument. This simplicity becomes instantly
apparent when it is found that the circuit breaker,
instead of revolving as it does in other types, is stationary
and that the whole breaker mechanism is exposed by
simply turning the cover spring aside and removing
cover. This makes inspection and adjustment particularly
simple, and the fact that no special tool is necessary
for adjustment of the platinum points&mdash;an ordinary
small screw-driver is the whole &#8220;kit of tools&#8221; needed in
the work of disassembling or assembling&mdash;is a feature of
some value.</p>

Driver Adjusts Contact Points. B&mdash;Distributor Block Removed.
C&mdash;Taking off Magnets. D&mdash;Showing How Easily Condenser and High
Tension Windings are Removed.</p></div>

<p>With dust- and water-protecting casing removed, and
one of the magnets withdrawn, as in <a href="#Fig069">Fig. 69</a>, the winding
can be seen with its core resting on the field pole pieces
and the primary lead attached to its side. An important
feature of the high-tension winding is that the heads are
of insulating material, and there is not the tendency for
the high-tension current to jump to the side as in the
ordinary armature type magneto. The high-tension current
is carried to the distributor by means of an insulated
block with a spindle, at one end of which is a spring
brush bearing directly on the winding, thus shortening<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
the path of the high-tension current and eliminating the
use of rubber spools and insulating parts. The moving
parts of the magneto need never be disturbed if the high-tension
winding is to be removed. This winding constitutes
all of the magneto windings, no external spark
coil being necessary. The condenser is placed directly
above the winding and is easily removable by taking out
two screws, instead of being placed in an armature where
it is inaccessible except to an expert, and where it cannot
be replaced except at the factory whence it emanated.</p>

<p class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></p>

<h3>CARE OF THE DIXIE MAGNETO</h3>

<p>The bearings of the magneto are provided with oil
cups and a few drops of light oil every 1,000 miles are
sufficient. The breaker lever should be lubricated every
1,000 miles with a drop of light oil, applied with a tooth-pick.
The proper distance between the platinum points
when separated should not exceed .020 or one-fiftieth of
an inch. A gauge of the proper size is attached to the
screwdriver furnished with the magneto. The platinum
contacts should be kept clean and properly adjusted.
Should the contacts become pitted, a fine file should be
used to smooth them in order to permit them to come
into perfect contact. The distributor block should be
removed occasionally and inspected for an accumulation
of carbon dust. The inside of the distributor block should
be cleaned with a cloth moistened with gasoline and
then wiped dry with a clean cloth. When replacing the
block, care must be exercised in pushing the carbon brush
into the socket. Do not pull out the carbon brushes in the
distributor because you think there is not enough tension
on the small brass springs. In order to obtain the most
efficient results, the normal setting of the spark-plug
points should not exceed .025 of an inch, and it is advisable
to have the gap just right before a spark-plug is
inserted.</p>

<p>The spark-plug electrodes may be easily set by means
of the gauge attached to the screwdriver. <i>The setting
of the spark-plug points is an important function which
is usually overlooked, with the result that the magneto
is blamed when it is not at fault.</i></p>

<h3>TIMING OF THE DIXIE MAGNETO</h3>

<p>In order to obtain the utmost efficiency from the engine,
the magneto must be correctly timed to it. This
operation is usually performed when the magneto is fitted
to the engine at the factory. The correct setting may
vary according to individuality of the engine, and some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190"
id="Page_190">[190]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a></span>
engines may require an earlier setting in order to obtain
the best results. However, should the occasion arise to
retime the magneto, the procedure is as follows: Rotate
the crank-shaft of the engine until one of the pistons,
preferably that of cylinder No. 1, is <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub> of an inch ahead
of the end of the compression stroke. With the timing
lever in full retard position, the driving shaft of the
magneto should be rotated in the direction in which it
will be driven. The circuit breaker should be closely
observed and when the platinum contact points are about
to separate, the drive gear or coupling should be secured
to the drive shaft of the magneto. Care should be taken
not to alter the position of the magneto shaft when
tightening the nut to secure the gear or coupling, after
which the magneto should be secured to its base. Remove
the distributor block and determine which terminal
of the block is in contact with the carbon brush of the
distributor finger and connect with plug wire leading to
No. 1 cylinder to this terminal. Connect the remaining
plug wires in turn according to the proper sequence of
firing of the cylinders. (See the wiring diagram for a
typical six-cylinder engine at <a href="#Fig070">Fig. 70</a>.) A terminal on
the end of the cover spring of the magneto is provided
for the purpose of connecting the wire leading to a ground
switch for stopping the engine.</p>

be possible with the two-spark form. The application

<h3><a name="SecVI_15" id="SecVI_15"></a>SPARK-PLUG DESIGN AND APPLICATION</h3>

<p>With the high-tension system of ignition the spark is
produced by a current of high voltage jumping between
two points which break the complete circuit, which would
exist otherwise in the secondary coil and its external
connections. The spark-plug is a simple device which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
consists of two terminal electrodes carried in a suitable
shell member, which is screwed into the cylinder. Typical
spark-plugs are shown in section at <a href="#Fig072">Fig. 72</a> and the
construction can be easily understood. The secondary
wire from the coil is attached to a terminal at the top
of a central electrode member, which is supported in a
bushing of some form of insulating material. The type
shown at A employs a molded porcelain as an insulator,
while that depicted at B uses a bushing of mica. The
insulating bushing and electrode are housed in a steel
body, which is provided with a screw thread at the bottom,
by which means it is screwed into the combustion
chamber.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a name="Fig072" id="Fig072"></a>
<img src="images/illo188.png" alt="Fig. 72" width="600" height="316" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 72.&mdash;Spark-Plug Types Showing Construction and Arrangement
of Parts.</p></div>

<p>When porcelain is used as an insulating material it is
kept from direct contact with the metal portion by some
form of yielding packing, usually asbestos. This is necessary
because the steel and porcelain have different
coefficients of expansion and some flexibility must be
provided at the joints to permit the materials to expand
differently when heated. The steel body of the plug which
is screwed into the cylinder is in metallic contact with it
and carries sparking points which form one of the terminals
of the air gap over which the spark occurs. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
current entering at the top of the plug cannot reach the
ground, which is represented by the metal portion of the
engine, until it has traversed the full length of the central
electrode and overcome the resistance of the gap
between it and the terminal point on the shell. The
porcelain bushing is firmly seated against the asbestos
packing by means of a brass screw gland which sets
against a flange formed on the porcelain, and which
screws into a thread at the upper portion of the plug
body.</p>

<p>The mica plug shown at B is somewhat simpler in
construction than that shown at A. The mica core which
keeps the central electrode separated from the steel body
is composed of several layers of pure sheet mica wound
around the steel rod longitudinally, and hundreds of
stamped steel washers which are forced over this member
and compacted under high pressure with some form of a
binding material between them. Porcelain insulators are
usually molded from high-grade clay and are approximately
of the shapes desired by the designers of the plug.
The central electrode may be held in place by mechanical
means such as nuts, packings, and a shoulder on the rod,
as shown at A. Another method sometimes used is to
cement the electrode in place by means of some form of
fire-clay cement. Whatever method of fastening is used,
it is imperative that the joints be absolutely tight so that
no gas can escape at the time of explosion. Porcelain
is the material most widely used because it can be glazed
so that it will not absorb oil, and it is subjected to such
high temperature in baking that it is not liable to crack
when heated.</p>

<p>The spark-plugs may be screwed into any convenient
part of the combustion chamber, the general practice
being to install them in the caps over the inlet valves,
or in the side of the combustion chamber, so the points
will be directly in the path of the entering fresh gases
from the carburetor.</p>

<p>Other insulating materials sometimes used are glass,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
steatite (which is a form of soapstone) and lava. Mica
and porcelain are the two common materials used because
they give the best results. Glass is liable to crack, while
lava or the soapstone insulating bushings absorb oil.
The spark gap of the average plug is equal to about
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>32</sub> of an inch for coil ignition and <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>40</sub> of an inch when
used in magneto circuits. A simple gauge for determining
the gap setting is the thickness of an ordinary visiting
card for magneto plugs, or a space equal to the thickness
of a worn dime for a coil plug. The insulating bushings
are made in a number of different ways, and while details
of construction vary, spark-plugs do not differ essentially
in design. The dimensions of the standardized plug
recommended by the S. A. E. are shown at <a href="#Fig073">Fig. 73</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="Fig073" id="Fig073"></a>
<img src="images/illo190.png" alt="Fig. 73" width="500" height="356" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 73.&mdash;Standard Airplane Engine Plug Suggested by S. A. E. Standards
Committee.</p></div>

<p>It is often desirable to have a water-tight joint between
the high-tension cable and the terminal screw on
top of the insulating bushing of the spark-plug, especially
in marine applications. The plug shown at C, <a href="#Fig072">Fig. 72</a>,<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
is provided with an insulating member or hood of porcelain,
which is secured by a clip in such a manner that it
makes a water-tight connection. Should the porcelain
of a conventional form of plug become covered with
water or dirty oil, the high-tension current is apt to
run down this conducting material on the porcelain and
reach the ground without having to complete its circuit
by jumping the air gap and producing a spark. It will
be evident that wherever a plug is exposed to the elements,
which is often the case in airplane service, that it
should be protected by an insulating hood which will keep
the insulator dry and prevent short circuiting of the
spark. The same end can be attained by slipping an
ordinary rubber nipple over the porcelain insulator of
any conventional plug and bringing up one end over the
cable.</p>

<h3><a name="SecVI_16" id="SecVI_16"></a>TWO-SPARK IGNITION</h3>

<p>On most aviation engines, especially those having large
cylinders, it is sometimes difficult to secure complete
combustion by using a single-spark plug. If the combustion
is not rapid the efficiency of the engine will be
reduced proportionately. The compressed charge in the
cylinder does not ignite all at once or instantaneously,
as many assume, but it is the strata of gas nearest the
plug which is ignited first. This in turn sets fire to
consecutive layers of the charge until the entire mass
is aflame. One may compare the combustion of gas in
the gas-engine cylinder to the phenomenon which obtains
when a heavy object is thrown into a pool of still water.
First a small circle is seen at the point where the object
has passed into the water, this circle in turn inducing
other and larger circles until the whole surface of the
pool has been agitated from the one central point. The
method of igniting the gas is very similar, as the spark
ignites the circle of gas immediately adjacent to the
sparking point, and this circle in turn ignites a little
larger one concentric with it. The second circle of flame<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
sets fire to more of the gas, and finally the entire contents
of the combustion chamber are burning.</p>

<p>While ordinarily combustion is sufficiently rapid with
a single plug so that the proper explosion is obtained at
moderate engine speeds, if the engine is working fast and
the cylinders are of large capacity more power may be
obtained by setting fire to the mixture at two different
points instead of but one. This may be accomplished by
using two sparking-plugs in the cylinder instead of one,
and experiments have shown that it is possible to gain
from twenty-five to thirty per cent. in motor power at
high speed with two-spark plugs, because the combustion
of gas is accelerated by igniting the gas simultaneously
in two places. The double-plug system on airplane engines
is also a safeguard, as in event of failure of one
plug in the cylinder the other would continue to fire the
gas, and the engine will continue to function properly.</p>

<p>In using magneto ignition some precautions are necessary
relating to wiring and also the character of the spark-plugs
employed. The conductor should be of good quality,
have ample insulation, and be well protected from accumulations
of oil, which would tend to decompose rubber
insulation. It is customary to protect the wiring by running
it through the conduits of fiber or metal tubing lined
with insulating material. Multiple strand cables should
be used for both primary and secondary wiring, and the
insulation should be of rubber at least <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub> inch thick.</p>

<p>The spark-plugs commonly used for battery and coil
ignition cannot always be employed when a magneto is
fitted. The current produced by the mechanical generator
has a greater amperage and more heat value than that
obtained from transformer coils excited by battery current.
The greater heat may burn or fuse the slender
points used on some battery plugs and heavier electrodes
are needed to resist the heating effect of the more intense
arc. While the current has greater amperage it is not of
as high potential or voltage as that commonly produced
by the secondary winding of an induction coil, and it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
cannot overcome as much of a gap. Manufacturers of
magneto plugs usually set the spark points about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>64</sub> of
an inch apart. The most efficient magneto plug has a
plurality of points so that when the distance between one
set becomes too great the spark will take place between
one of the other pairs of electrodes which are not separated
by so great an air space.</p>

<h3><a name="SecVI_17" id="SecVI_17"></a>SPECIAL PLUGS FOR AIRPLANE WORK</h3>

<p>Airplane work calls for special construction of spark-plugs,
owing to the high compression used in the engines
and the fact that they are operated on open throttle practically
all the time, thus causing a great deal of heat to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
be developed. The plug shown at <a href="#Fig074">Fig. 74</a> was recently
described in &#8220;The Automobile,&#8221; and has been devised
especially for airplane engines and automobile racing
power plants. The core C is built up of mica washers,
and has square shoulders. As mica washers of different
sizes may be used, and accurate machining, such as is necessary
with conical clamping surfaces, is not required,
the plug can be produced economically. The square
shoulders of the core afford two gasket seats, and when
the core is clamped in the shell by means of check nut E,
it is accurately centered and a tight joint is formed. This
construction also makes a shorter plug than where conical
fits are used, thus improving the heat radiation through
the stem. The lower end of the shell is provided with a
baffle plate O, which tends to keep the oil away from the
mica. There are perforations L in this baffle plate to
prevent burnt gases being pocketed behind the baffle plate
and pre-igniting the new charge. This construction also
brings the firing point out into the firing chamber of the
engine, and has all the other advantages of a closed-end
plug. The stem P is made of brass or copper, on account
of their superior heat conductivity, and the electrode J
is swedged into the bottom of the stem, as shown at K,
in a secure manner.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="Fig074" id="Fig074"></a>
<img src="images/illo193.png" alt="Fig. 74" width="400" height="394" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 74.&mdash;Special Mica Plug for Aviation Engines.</p></div>

<p>The shell is finned, as shown at G, to provide greater
heat radiating surface. There is also a fin F at the top
of the stem, to increase the radiation of heat from the
stem and electrode. The top of this finned portion is
slightly countersunk, and the stem is riveted into same,
thereby reducing the possibility of leakage past the
threads on the stem. This finned portion is necked at A
to take a slip terminal.</p>

<p>In building up the core a small section of washers, I,
is built up before the mica insulating tube D is placed on.
This construction gives a better support to section I.
Baffle plate O is bored out to allow the electrode J to
pass through, and the clearance between baffle plate and
electrode is made larger than the width of the gap between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
the firing points, so that there is no danger of the
spark jumping from the electrode to the baffle plate.</p>

<p>This plug will be furnished either with or without the
finned portion, to meet individual requirements. The
manufacturers lay special stress upon the simplicity of
construction and upon the method of clamping, which is
claimed to make the plug absolutely gas-tight.</p>

<h3><a name="SecVII_1" id="SecVII_1"></a>WHY LUBRICATION IS NECESSARY</h3>

<p>The importance of minimizing friction at the various
bearing surfaces of machines to secure mechanical efficiency
is fully recognized by all mechanics, and proper
lubricity of all parts of the mechanism is a very essential
factor upon which the durability and successful operation
of the motor car power plant depends. All of the moving
members of the engine which are in contact with other
portions, whether the motion is continuous or intermittent,
of high or low velocity, or of rectilinear or continued
rotary nature, should be provided with an adequate supply
of oil. No other assemblage of mechanism is operated
under conditions which are so much to its disadvantage
as the motor car, and the tendency is toward a simplification
of oiling methods so that the supply will be ample
and automatically applied to the points needing it.</p>

<p>In all machinery in motion the members which are in
contact have a tendency to stick to each other, and the
very minute projections which exist on even the smoothest
of surfaces would have a tendency to cling or adhere
to each other if the surfaces were not kept apart by some
elastic and unctuous substance. This will flow or spread
out over the surfaces and smooth out the inequalities existing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
which tend to produce heat and retard motion of the
pieces relative to each other.</p>

<p>A general impression which obtains is that well machined
surfaces are smooth, but while they are apparently
free from roughness, and no projections are visible to the
naked eye, any smooth bearing surface, even if very carefully
ground, will have a rough appearance if examined
with a magnifying glass. An exaggerated condition to
illustrate this point is shown at <a href="#Fig075">Fig. 75</a>. The amount of
friction will vary in proportion to the pressure on the
surfaces in contact and will augment as the loads increase;
the rougher surfaces will have more friction than
smoother ones and soft bodies will produce more friction
than hard substances.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="Fig075" id="Fig075"></a>
<img src="images/illo198.png" alt="Fig. 75" width="450" height="355" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 75.&mdash;Showing Use of Magnifying Glass to Demonstrate that Apparently
Smooth Metal Surfaces May Have Minute Irregularities which Produce
Friction.</p></div>

<h3><a name="SecVII_2" id="SecVII_2"></a>FRICTION DEFINED</h3>

<p>Friction is always present in any mechanism as a resisting
force that tends to retard motion and bring all
moving parts to a state of rest. The absorption of power
by friction may be gauged by the amount of heat which
exists at the bearing points. Friction of solids may be
divided into two classes: sliding friction, such as exists
between the piston and cylinder, or the bearings of a
gas-engine, and rolling friction, which is that present
when the load is supported by ball or roller bearings, or
that which exists between the tires or the driving wheels
and the road. Engineers endeavor to keep friction losses
as low as possible, and much care is taken in all modern
airplane engines to provide adequate methods of lubrication,
or anti-friction bearings at all points where considerable
friction exists.</p>

<h3><a name="SecVII_3" id="SecVII_3"></a>THEORY OF LUBRICATION</h3>

<p>The reason a lubricant is supplied to bearing points
will be easily understood if one considers that these
elastic substances flow between the close fitting surfaces,
and by filling up the minute depressions in the surfaces
and covering the high spots act as a cushion which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
absorbs the heat generated and takes the wear instead
of the metallic bearing surface. The closer the parts fit
together the more fluid the lubricant must be to pass
between their surfaces, and at the same time it must
possess sufficient body so that it will not be entirely
forced out by the pressure existing between the parts.</p>

<p>Oils should have good adhesive, as well as cohesive,
qualities. The former are necessary so that the oil film
will cling well to the surfaces of the bearings; the latter,
so the oil particles will cling together and resist the tendency
to separation which exists all the time the bearings
are in operation. When used for gas-engine lubrication
the oil should be capable of withstanding considerable
heat in order that it will not be vaporized by the hot portions
of the cylinder. It should have sufficient cold test
so that it will remain fluid and flow readily at low temperature.
Lubricants should be free from acid, or alkalies,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
which tend to produce a chemical action with metals
and result in corrosion of the parts to which they are
applied. It is imperative that the oil be exactly the
proper quality and nature for the purpose intended and
that it be applied in a positive manner. The requirements
may be briefly summarized as follows:</p>

<p>First&mdash;It must have sufficient body to prevent seizing
of the parts to which it is applied and between which it
is depended upon to maintain an elastic film, and yet it
must not have too much viscosity, in order to minimize
the internal or fluid friction which exists between the
particles of the lubricant itself.</p>

<p>Second&mdash;The lubricant must not coagulate or gum;
must not injure the parts to which it is applied, either by
chemical action or by producing injurious deposits, and
it should not evaporate readily.</p>

<p>Third&mdash;The character of the work will demand that
the oil should not vaporize when heated or thicken to such
a point that it will not flow readily when cold.</p>

<p>Fourth&mdash;The oil must be free from acid, alkalies, animal
or vegetable fillers, or other injurious agencies.</p>

<p>Fifth&mdash;It must be carefully selected for the work required
and should be a good conductor of heat.</p>

<h3><a name="SecVII_4" id="SecVII_4"></a>DERIVATION OF LUBRICANTS</h3>

<p>The first oils which were used for lubricating machinery
were obtained from animal and vegetable sources,
though at the present time most unguents are of mineral
derivation. Lubricants may exist as fluids, semifluids, or
solids. The viscosity will vary from light spindle or
dynamo oils, which have but little more body than kerosene,
to the heaviest greases and tallows. The most common
solid employed as a lubricant is graphite, sometimes
termed &#8220;plumbago&#8221; or &#8220;black lead.&#8221; This substance is
of mineral derivation.</p>

<p>The disadvantage of oils of organic origin, such as
those obtained from animal fats or vegetable substances,
is that they will absorb oxygen from the atmosphere,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
which causes them to thicken or become rancid. Such
oils have a very poor cold test, as they solidify at comparatively
high temperatures, and their flashing point is
so low that they cannot be used at points where much
heat exists. In most animal oils various acids are present
in greater or less quantities, and for this reason they are
not well adapted for lubricating metallic surfaces which
may be raised high enough in temperature to cause decomposition
of the oils.</p>

<p>Lubricants derived from the crude petroleum are
called &#8220;Oleonaphthas&#8221; and they are a product of the
process of refining petroleum through which gasoline and
kerosene are obtained. They are of lower cost than vegetable
or animal oil, and as they are of non-organic origin,
they do not become rancid or gummy by constant exposure
to the air, and they will have no corrosive action
on metals because they contain no deleterious substances
in chemical composition. By the process of fractional
distillation mineral oils of all grades can be obtained.
They have a lower cold and higher flash test and there
is not the liability of spontaneous combustion that exists
with animal oils.</p>

<p>The organic oils are derived from fatty substances,
which are present in the bodies of all animals and in
some portions of plants. The general method of extracting
oil from animal bodies is by a rendering process,
which consists of applying sufficient heat to liquefy the
oil and then separating it from the tissue with which it
is combined by compression. The only oil which is used
to any extent in gas-engine lubrication that is not of
mineral derivation is castor oil. This substance has been
used on high-speed racing automobile engines and on
airplane power plants. It is obtained from the seeds of
the castor plant, which contain a large percentage of oil.</p>

<p>Among the solid substances which may be used for
lubricating purposes may be mentioned tallow, which is
obtained from the fat of animals, and graphite and soapstone,
which are of mineral derivation. Tallow is never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
used at points where it will be exposed to much heat,
though it is often employed as a filler for greases used
in transmission gearing of autos. Graphite is sometimes
mixed with oil and applied to cylinder lubrication, though
it is most often used in connection with greases in the
landing gear parts and for coating wires and cables of
the airplane. Graphite is not affected by heat, cold, acids,
or alkalies, and has a strong attraction for metal surfaces.
It mixes readily with oils and greases and increases their
efficiency in many applications. It is sometimes used
where it would not be possible to use other lubricants
because of extremes of temperature.</p>

<p>The oils used for cylinder lubrication are obtained
almost exclusively from crude petroleum derived from
American wells. Special care must be taken in the selection
of crude material, as every variety will not yield oil
of the proper quality to be used as a cylinder lubricant.
The crude petroleum is distilled as rapidly as possible
with fire heat to vaporize off the naphthas and the burning
oils. After these vapors have been given off superheated
steam is provided to assist in distilling. When
enough of the light elements have been eliminated the
residue is drawn off, passed through a strainer to free
it from grit and earthy matters, and is afterwards cooled
to separate the wax from it. This is the dark cylinder oil
and is the grade usually used for steam-engine cylinders.</p>

<h3><a name="SecVII_5" id="SecVII_5"></a>PROPERTIES OF CYLINDER OILS</h3>

<p>The oil that is to be used in the gasoline engine must
be of high quality, and for that reason the best grades
are distilled in a vacuum that the light distillates may be
separated at much lower temperatures than ordinary
conditions of distilling permit. If the degree of heat
is not high the product is not so apt to decompose and
deposit carbon. If it is desired to remove the color of
the oil which is caused by free carbon and other impurities
it can be accomplished by filtering the oil through charcoal.
The greater the number of times the oil is filtered,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
the lighter it will become in color. The best cylinder
oils have flash points usually in excess of 500 degrees F.,
and while they have a high degree of viscosity at 100
degrees F. they become more fluid as the temperature
increases.</p>

<p>The lubricating oils obtained by refining crude petroleum
may be divided into three classes:</p>

<p>First&mdash;The natural oils of great body which are prepared
for use by allowing the crude material to settle
in tanks at high temperature and from which the impurities
are removed by natural filtration. These oils are
given the necessary body and are free from the volatile
substances they contain by means of superheated steam
which provides a source of heat.</p>

<p>Second&mdash;Another grade of these natural oils which are
filtered again at high temperatures and under pressure
through beds of animal charcoal to improve their color.</p>

<p>Third&mdash;Pale, limpid oils, obtained by distillation and
subsequent chemical treatment from the residuum produced
in refining petroleum to obtain the fuel oils.</p>

<p>Authorities agree that any form of mixed oil in which
animal and mineral lubricants are combined should never
be used in the cylinder of a gas engine as the admixture
of the lubricants does not prevent the decomposition of
the organic oil into the glycerides and fatty acids peculiar
to the fat used. In a gas-engine cylinder the flame tends
to produce more or less charring. The deposits of carbon
will be much greater with animal oils than with those
derived from the petroleum base because the constituents
of a fat or tallow are not of the same volatile character
as those which comprise the hydro-carbon oils which will
evaporate or volatilize before they char in most instances.</p>

<h3><a name="SecVII_6" id="SecVII_6"></a>FACTORS INFLUENCING LUBRICATION SYSTEM SELECTION</h3>

<p>The suitability of oil for the proper and efficient lubrication
of all internal combustion engines is determined
chiefly by the following factors:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>1. Type of cooling system (operating temperatures).</p>

<p>2. Type of lubricating system (method of applying
oil to the moving parts).</p>

<p>3. Rubbing speeds of contact surfaces.</p>

<p>Were the operating temperatures, bearing surface
speeds and lubrication systems identical, a single oil
could be used in all engines with equal satisfaction. The
only change then necessary in viscosity would be that due
to climatic conditions. As engines are now designed, only
three grades of oil are necessary for the lubrication of
all types with the exception of Knight, air-cooled and
some engines which run continuously at full load. In the
specification of engine lubricants the feature of load
carried by the engine should be carefully considered.</p>

<p><i>Full Load Engines.</i></p>

<li>Marine.</li>
<li>Racing automobile.</li>
<li>Aviation.</li>

<ol>
<li>Pleasure automobile.</li>
<li>Commercial vehicle.</li>
<li>Motor cycle.</li>
<li>Some stationary.</li>
</ol>

<p>Of the forms outlined, the only one we have any
immediate concern about is the airplane power plant.
The Platt &amp; Washburn Refining Company, who have
made a careful study of the lubrication problem as applied
to all types of engines, have found a peculiar set
of conditions to apply to oiling high-speed constant-duty
or &#8220;full-load&#8221; engines. Modern airplane engines are
designed to operate continuously at a fairly uniform
high rotative speed and at full load over long periods
of time. As a sequence to this heavy duty the operating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
temperatures are elevated. For the sake of extreme lightness
in weight of all parts, very thin alloy steel aluminum
or cast iron pistons are fitted and the temperature of
the thin piston heads at the center reaches anywhere
between <span class="nowrap">600&deg;</span> and <span class="nowrap">1,400&deg;</span> Fahr., as in automobile racing
engines. Freely exposed to such intense heat hydro-carbon
oils are partially &#8220;cracked&#8221; into light and heavy products
or polymerized into solid hydro-carbons. From these
facts it follows that only heavy mineral oils of low carbon
residue and of the greatest chemical purity and stability
should be used to secure good lubrication. In all cases
the oil should be sufficiently heavy to assure the highest
horse-power and fuel and oil economy compatible with
perfect lubrication, avoiding, at the same time, carbonization
and ignition failure. When aluminum pistons are
used their superior heat-conducting properties aid materially
in reducing the rate of oil destruction.</p>

<p>The extraordinary evolutions described by airplanes
in flight make it a matter of vital necessity to operate
engines inclined at all angles to the vertical as well as in
an upside-down position. To meet this situation lubricating
systems have been elaborated so as to deliver
an abundance of oil where needed and to eliminate possible
flooding of cylinders. This is done by applying a
full force feed system, distributing oil under considerable
pressure to all working parts. Discharged through the
bearings, the oil drains down to the suction side of a
second pump located in the bottom of the base chamber.
This pump being of greater capacity than the first prevents
the accumulation of oil in the crank-case, and
forces it to a separate oil reservoir-cooler, whence it
flows back in rapid circulation to the pump feeding the
bearings. With this arrangement positive lubrication
is entirely independent of engine position. The lubricating
system of the Thomas-Morse aviation engines,
which is shown at <a href="#Fig076">Fig. 76</a>, is typical of current practice.</p>

<h3><a name="SecVII_7" id="SecVII_7"></a>GNOME TYPE ENGINES USE CASTOR OIL</h3>

<p>The construction and operation of rotative radial
cylinder engines introduce additional difficulties of lubrication
to those already referred to and merit especial
attention. Owing to the peculiar alimentation systems
of Gnome type engines, atomized gasoline mixed with
air is drawn through the hollow stationary crank-shaft
directly into the crank-case which it fills on the way to
the cylinders. Therein lies the trouble. Hydrocarbon
oils are soon dissolved by the gasoline and washed off,
leaving the bearing surfaces without adequate protection
and exposed to instant wear and destruction. So castor
oil is resorted to as an indispensable but unfortunate
compromise. Of vegetable origin, it leaves a much more
bulky carbon deposit in the explosion chambers than
does mineral oil and its great affinity for oxygen causes
the formation of voluminous gummy deposit in the crank-case.
Engines employing it need to be dismounted and
thoroughly scraped out at frequent intervals. It is advisable
to use only unblended chemically pure castor oil
in rotative engines, first by virtue of its insolubility in
gasoline and second because its extra heavy body can
resist the high temperature of air-cooled cylinders.</p>

<h3><a name="SecVII_8" id="SecVII_8"></a>HALL-SCOTT LUBRICATION SYSTEM</h3>

<p>The oiling system of the Hall-Scott type A-5 125
horse-power engine is clearly shown at <a href="#Fig077">Fig. 77</a>. It is
completely described in the instruction book issued by
the company from which the following extracts are reproduced
by permission. Crank-shaft, connecting rods and
all other parts within the crank-case and cylinders are
lubricated directly or indirectly by a force-feed oiling
system. The cylinder walls and wrist pins are lubricated
by oil spray thrown from the lower end of connecting
rod bearings. This system is used only upon A-5 engines.
Upon A-7a and A-5a engines a small tube supplies oil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
from connecting rod bearing directly upon the wrist pin.
The oil is drawn from the strainer located at the lowest
portion of the lower crank-case, forced around the main
intake manifold oil jacket. From here it is circulated
to the main distributing pipe located along the lower left
hand side of upper crank-case. The oil is then forced
directly to the lower side of crank-shaft, through holes
drilled in each main bearing cup. Leakage from these
main bearings is caught in scuppers placed upon the
cheeks of the crank-shafts furnishing oil under pressure
to the connecting rod bearings. A-7a and A-5a engines
have small tubes leading from these bearings which convey
the oil under pressure to the wrist pins.</p>

<p class='pagenum' style="margin-top: -1.5em;"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;"><a name="Fig077" id="Fig077"></a>
<img src="images/illo207.png" alt="Fig. 77" width="650" height="397" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 77.&mdash;Diagram of Oiling System, Hall-Scott Type A 125 Horse-Power Engine.</p></div>

<p>A bi-pass located at the front end of the distributing
oil pipe can be regulated to lessen or raise the pressure.
By screwing the valve in, the pressure will raise and
more oil will be forced to the bearings. By unscrewing,
pressure is reduced and less oil is fed. A-7a and A-5a
engines have oil relief valves located just off of the main
oil pump in the lower crank-case. This regulates the
pressure at all times so that in cold weather there will
be no danger of bursting oil pipes due to excessive pressure.
If it is found the oil pressure is not maintained
at a high enough level, inspect this valve. A stronger
spring will not allow the oil to bi-pass so freely, and
consequently the pressure will be raised; a weaker spring
will bi-pass more oil and reduce the oil pressure materially.
Independent of the above-mentioned system, a
small, directly driven rotary oiler feeds oil to the base
of each individual cylinder. The supply of oil is furnished
by the main oil pump located in the lower crank-case.
A small sight-feed regulator is furnished to control
the supply of oil from this oiler. This instrument should
be placed higher than the auxiliary oil distributor itself
to enable the oil to drain by gravity feed to the oiler.
If there is no available place with the necessary height
in the front seat of plane, connect it directly to the intake
L fitting on the oiler in an upright position. It should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
be regulated with full open throttle to maintain an oil
level in the glass, approximately half way.</p>

<p>An oil pressure gauge is provided. This should be run
to the pilot&#8217;s instrument board. The gauge registers the
oil pressure upon the bearings, also determining its circulation.
Strict watch should be maintained of this instrument
by pilot, and if for any reason its hand should
drop to 0 the motor should be immediately stopped and
the trouble found before restarting engine. Care should
be taken that the oil does not work up into the gauge,
as it will prevent the correct gauge registering of oil
pressure. The oil pressure will vary according to weather
conditions and viscosity of oil used. In normal weather,
with the engine properly warmed up, the pressure will
register on the oil gauge from 5 to 10 pounds when the
engine is turning from 1,275 to 1,300 r. p. m. This does
not apply to all aviation engines, however, as the proper
pressure advised for the Curtiss OX-2 motor is from 40
to 55 pounds at the gauge.</p>

<p>The oil sump plug is located at the lowest point of
the lower crank-case. This is a combination dirt, water
and sediment trap. It is easily removed by unscrewing.
Oil is furnished mechanically to the cam-shaft housing
under pressure through a small tube leading from the
main distributing pipe at the propeller end of engine
directly into the end of cam-shaft housing. The opposite
end of this housing is amply relieved to allow the oil
to rapidly flow down upon cam-shaft, magneto, pinion-shaft,
and crank-shaft gears, after which it returns to
lower crank-case. An outside overflow pipe is also provided
to carry away the surplus oil.</p>

<h3>DRAINING OIL FROM CRANK-CASE</h3>

<p>The oil strainer is placed at the lowest point of the
lower crank-case. This strainer should be removed after
every five to eight hours running of the engine and
cleaned thoroughly with gasoline. It is also advisable
to squirt distillate up into the case through the opening<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
where the strainer has been removed. Allow this distillate
to drain out thoroughly before replacing the plug
with strainer attached. Be sure gasket is in place on
plug before replacing. Pour new oil in through either
of the two breather pipes on exhaust side of motor.
Be sure to replace strainer screens if removed. If,
through oversight, the engine does not receive sufficient
lubrication and begins to heat or pound, it should be
stopped immediately. After allowing engine to cool pour
at least three gallons of oil into oil sump. Fill radiator
with water after engine has cooled. Should there be
apparent damage, the engine should be thoroughly inspected
immediately without further running. If no obvious
damage has been done, the engine should be given
a careful examination at the earliest opportunity to see
that the running without oil has not burned the bearings
or caused other trouble.</p>

<p>Oils best adapted for Hall-Scott engines have the following
properties: A flash test of not less than <span class="nowrap">400&deg;</span> F.;
viscosity of not less than 75 to 85 taken at <span class="nowrap">21&deg;</span> F. with
Saybolt&#8217;s Universal Viscosimeter.</p>

<p><i>Zeroline heavy duty oil</i>, manufactured by the Standard
Oil Company of California; also,</p>

<p><i>Gargoyle mobile B oil</i>, manufactured by the Vacuum
Oil Company, both fulfill the above specifications. One
or the other of these oils can be obtained all over the
world.</p>

<p>Monogram extra heavy is also recommended.</p>

<h3><a name="SecVII_9" id="SecVII_9"></a>OIL SUPPLY BY CONSTANT LEVEL SPLASH SYSTEM</h3>

<p>The splash system of lubrication that depends on the
connecting rod to distribute the lubricant is one of the
most successful and simplest forms for simple four- and
six-cylinder vertical automobile engines, but is not as
well adapted to the oiling of airplane power plants for
reasons previously stated. If too much oil is supplied
the surplus will work past the piston rings and into the
combustion chamber, where it will burn and cause carbon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
deposits. Too much oil will also cause an engine to smoke
and an excess of lubricating oil is usually manifested
by a bluish-white smoke issuing from the exhaust.</p>

<p>A good method of maintaining a constant level of oil
for the successful application of the splash system is
shown at <a href="#Fig078">Fig. 78</a>. The engine base casting includes a
separate chamber which serves as an oil container and
which is below the level of oil in the crank-case. The
lubricant is drawn from the sump or oil container by
means of a positive oil pump which discharges directly
into the engine case. The level is maintained by an overflow
pipe which allows all excess lubricant to flow back
into the oil container at the bottom of the cylinder.
Before passing into the pump again the oil is strained
or filtered by a screen of wire gauze and all foreign
matter removed. Owing to the rapid circulation of the
oil it may be used over and over again for quite a period
of time. The oil is introduced directly into the crank-case
by a breather pipe and the level is indicated by
a rod carried by a float which rises when the container is
replenished and falls when the available supply diminishes.
It will be noted that with such system the only
apparatus required besides the oil tank which is cast
integral with the bottom of the crank-case is a suitable
pump to maintain circulation of oil. This member is
always positively driven, either by means of shaft and
universal coupling or direct gearing. As the system is
entirely automatic in action, it will furnish a positive
supply of oil at all desired points, and it cannot be
tampered with by the inexpert because no adjustments
are provided or needed.</p>

<h3><a name="SecVII_10" id="SecVII_10"></a>DRY CRANK-CASE SYSTEM BEST FOR AIRPLANE ENGINES</h3>

<p>In most airplane power plants it is considered desirable
to supply the oil directly to the parts needing it by suitable
leads instead of depending solely upon the distributing
action of scoops on the connecting rod big ends.
A system of this nature is shown at <a href="#Fig077">Fig. 77</a>. The
oil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
is carried in the crank-case, as is common practice, but
the normal oil level is below the point where it will be
reached by the connecting rod. It is drawn from the
crank-case by a plunger pump which directs it to a manifold
leading directly to conductors which supply the main<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
journals. After the oil has been used on these points it
drains back into the bottom of the crank-case. An excess
is provided which is supplied to the connecting rod ends
by passages drilled into the webs of the crank-shaft and
part way into the crank-pins as shown by the dotted
lines. The oil which is present at the connecting rod
crank-pins is thrown off by centrifugal force and lubricates
the cylinder walls and other internal parts. Regulating
screws are provided so that the amount of oil
supplied the different points may be regulated at will.
A relief check valve is installed to take care of excess
lubricant and to allow any oil that does not pass back
into the pipe line to overflow or bi-pass into the main
container.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="Fig079" id="Fig079"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 79.&mdash;Pressure Feed Oil-Supply System of Airplane Power Plants has
Many Good Features.</p></div>

<p>A simple system of this nature is shown graphically
in a phantom view of the crank-case at <a href="#Fig079">Fig. 79</a>,
in which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
the oil passages are made specially prominent. The oil
is taken from a reservoir at the bottom of the engine
base by the usual form of gear oil pump and is supplied
to a main feed manifold which extends the length of the
crank-case. Individual conductors lead to the five main
bearings, which in turn supply the crank-pins by passages
drilled through the crank-shaft web. In this power
plant the connecting rods are hollow section bronze
castings and the passage through the center of the connecting
rod serves to convey the lubricant from the
crank-pins to the wrist-pins. The cylinder walls are oiled
by the spray of lubricant thrown off the revolving crank-shaft
by centrifugal force. Oil projection by the dippers
on the connecting rod ends from constant level troughs
is unequal upon the cylinder walls of the two-cylinder
blocks of an eight- or twelve-cylinder V engine. This
gives rise, on one side of the engine, to under-lubrication,
and, on the other side, to over-lubrication, as shown at
<a href="#Fig080">Fig. 80</a>, A. This applies to all modifications of splash
lubricating systems.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 80.&mdash;Why Pressure Feed System is Best for Eight-Cylinder Vee

<p>When a force-feed lubricating system is used, the oil,
escaping past the cheeks of both ends of the crank-pin
bearings, is thrown off at a tangent to the crank-pin
circle in all directions, supplying the cylinders on both
sides with an equal quantity of oil, as at <a href="#Fig080">Fig. 80</a>, B.</p>

<h3><a name="SecVII_11" id="SecVII_11"></a>WHY COOLING SYSTEMS ARE NECESSARY</h3>

<p>The reader should understand from preceding chapters
that the power of an internal-combustion motor is
obtained by the rapid combustion and consequent expansion
of some inflammable gas. The operation in
brief is that when air or any other gas or vapor is
heated, it will expand and that if this gas is confined
in a space which will not permit expansion, pressure will
be exerted against all sides of the containing chamber.
The more a gas is heated, the more pressure it will
exert upon the walls of the combustion chamber it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
confines. Pressure in a gas may be created by increasing
its temperature and inversely heat may be created by
pressure. When a gas is compressed its total volume is
reduced and the temperature is augmented.</p>

<p>The efficiency of any form of heat engine is determined
by the power obtained from a certain fuel consumption.
A definite amount of energy will be liberated
in the form of heat when a pound of any fuel is burned.
The efficiency of any heat engine is proportional to the
power developed from a definite quantity of fuel with the
least loss of thermal units. If the greater proportion
of the heat units derived by burning the explosive mixture
could be utilized in doing useful work, the efficiency
of the gasoline engine would be greater than that of
any other form of energizing power. There is a great
loss of heat from various causes, among which can be
cited the reduction of pressure through cooling the motor
and the loss of heat through the exhaust valves when
the burned gases are expelled from the cylinder.</p>

<p>The loss through the water jacket of the average automobile
power plant is over 50 per cent. of the total fuel
efficiency. This means that more than half of the heat
units available for power are absorbed and dissipated
by the cooling water. Another 16 per cent. is lost through
the exhaust valve, and but 33<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>3</sub> per cent. of the heat
units do useful work. The great loss of heat through
the cooling systems cannot be avoided, as some method
must be provided to keep the temperature of the engine
within proper bounds. It is apparent that the rapid
combustion and continued series of explosions would
soon heat the metal portions of the engine to a red heat
if some means were not taken to conduct much of this
heat away. The high temperature of the parts would
burn the lubricating oil, even that of the best quality,
and the piston and rings would expand to such a degree,
especially when deprived of oil, that they would seize in
the cylinder. This would score the walls, and the friction
which ensued would tend to bind the parts so tightly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
that the piston would stick, bearings would be burned
out, the valves would warp, and the engine would soon
become inoperative.</p>

Guide to Understand Airplane Power Plant Heat.</p></div>

<p>The best temperature to secure efficient operation is
one on which considerable difference of opinion exists
among engineers. The fact that the efficiency of an
engine is dependent upon the ratio of heat converted
into useful work compared to that generated by the
explosion of the gas is an accepted fact. It is very
important that the engine should not get too hot, and
on the other hand it is equally vital that the cylinders
be not robbed of too much heat. The object of cylinder
cooling is to keep the temperature of the cylinder below
the danger point, but at the same time to have it as
high as possible to secure maximum power from the
gas burned. The usual operating temperatures of an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
automobile engine are shown at <a href="#Fig081">Fig. 81</a>, and this can
be taken as an approximation of the temperatures apt to
exist in an airplane engine of conventional design as well
when at ground level or not very high in the air. The
newer very high compression airplane engines in which
compressions of eight or nine atmospheres are used, or
about 125 pounds per square inch, will run considerably
hotter than the temperatures indicated.</p>

<h3><a name="SecVII_12" id="SecVII_12"></a>COOLING SYSTEMS GENERALLY APPLIED</h3>

<p>There are two general systems of engine cooling in
common use, that in which water is heated by the absorption
of heat from the engine and then cooled by air,
and the other method in which the air is directed onto
the cylinder and absorbs the heat directly instead of
through the medium of water. When the liquid is employed
in cooling it is circulated through jackets which
surround the cylinder casting and the water may be
kept in motion by two methods. The one generally
favored is to use a positive circulating pump of some
form which is driven by the engine to keep the water
in motion. The other system is to utilize a natural
principle that heated water is lighter than cold liquid
and that it will tend to rise to the top of the cylinder
when it becomes heated to the proper temperature and
cooled water takes its place at the bottom of the water
jacket.</p>

<p>Air-cooling methods may be by radiation or convection.
In the former case the effective outer surface of
the cylinder is increased by the addition of flanges
machined or cast thereon, and the air is depended on
to rise from the cylinder as heated and be replaced by
cooler air. This, of course, is found only on stationary
engines. When a positive air draught is directed against
the cylinder by means of the propeller slip stream in
an airplane, cooling is by convection and radiation both.
Sometimes the air draught may be directed against the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
cylinder walls by some form of jacket which confines it
to the heated portions of the cylinder.</p>

<h3><a name="SecVII_13" id="SecVII_13"></a>COOLING BY POSITIVE WATER CIRCULATION</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="Fig082" id="Fig082"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 82.&mdash;Water Cooling of Salmson Seven-Cylinder Radial Airplane Engine.</p></div>

<p>A typical water-cooling system in which a pump is
depended upon to promote circulation of the cooling
liquid is shown at <a href="#Fig082">Figs. 82</a> and <a href="#Fig083">83</a>. The radiator is carried
at the front end of the fuselage in most cases, and
serves as a combined water tank and cooler, but in some
cases it is carried at the side of the engine, as in <a href="#Fig084">Fig.
84</a>, or attached to the central portion of the aerofoil or
wing structure. It is composed of an upper and lower
portion joined together by a series of pipes which may
be round and provided with a series of fins to radiate
the heat, or which may be flat in order to have the water
pass through in thin sheets and cool it more easily.
Cellular or honeycomb coolers are composed of a large
number of bent tubes which will expose a large area of
surface to the cooling influence of the air draught forced
through the radiator either by the forward movement
of the vehicle or by some type of fan. The cellular and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
flat tube types have almost entirely displaced the flange
tube radiators which were formerly popular because they
cool the water more effectively, and may be made lighter
than the tubular radiator could be for engines of the
same capacity.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="Fig083" id="Fig083"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 83.&mdash;How Water Cooling System of Thomas Airplane Engine is
Installed in Fuselage.</p></div>

<p>The water is drawn from the lower header of the
radiator by the pump and is forced through a manifold
to the lower portion of the water jackets of the cylinder.
It becomes heated as it passes around the cylinder walls
and combustion chambers and the hot water passes out
of the top of the water jacket to the upper portion of
the radiator. Here it is divided in thin streams and
directed against comparatively cool metal which abstracts
the heat from the water. As it becomes cooler it falls
to the bottom of the radiator because its weight increases
as the temperature becomes lower. By the time it reaches<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
the lower tank of the radiator it has been cooled sufficiently
so that it may be again passed around the cylinders
of the motor. The popular form of circulating
pump is known as the &#8220;centrifugal type&#8221; because a rotary
impeller of paddle-wheel form throws water which it
receives at a central point toward the outside and thus
causes it to maintain a definite rate of circulation. The
pump is always a separate appliance attached to the
engine and driven by positive gearing or direct-shaft
connection. The centrifugal pump is not as positive as
the gear form, and some manufacturers prefer the latter
because of the positive pumping features. They are
very simple in form, consisting of a suitable cast body
in which a pair of spur pinions having large teeth are
carried. One of these gears is driven by suitable means,
and as it turns the other member they maintain a flow
of water around the pump body. The pump should always
be installed in series with the water pipe which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
conveys the cool liquid from the lower compartment of the
radiator to the coolest portion of the water jacket.</p>

<h3><a name="SecVII_14" id="SecVII_14"></a>WATER CIRCULATION BY NATURAL SYSTEM</h3>

<p>Some automobile engineers contend that the rapid
water circulation obtained by using a pump may cool
the cylinders too much, and that the temperature of the
engine may be reduced so much that the efficiency will
be lessened. For this reason there is a growing tendency
to use the natural method of water circulation as the
cooling liquid is supplied to the cylinder jackets just
below the boiling point and the water issues from the
jacket at the top of the cylinder after it has absorbed
sufficient heat to raise it just about to the boiling point.</p>

<p>As the water becomes heated by contact with the hot
cylinder and combustion-chamber walls it rises to the top
of the water jacket, flows to the cooler, where enough
of the heat is absorbed to cause it to become sensibly
greater in weight. As the water becomes cooler, it falls
to the bottom of the radiator and it is again supplied
to the water jacket. The circulation is entirely automatic
and continues as long as there is a difference in temperature
between the liquid in the water spaces of the
engine and that in the cooler. The circulation becomes
brisker as the engine becomes hotter and thus the temperature
of the cylinders is kept more nearly to a fixed
point. With the thermosyphon system the cooling liquid
is nearly always at its boiling point, whereas if the circulation
is maintained by a pump the engine will become
cooler at high speed and will heat up more at low speed.</p>

<p>With the thermosyphon, or natural system of cooling,
more water must be carried than with the pump-maintained
circulation methods. The water spaces around
the cylinders should be larger, the inlet and discharge
water manifolds should have greater capacity, and be
free from sharp corners which might impede the flow.
The radiator must also carry more water than the form
used in connection with the pump because of the brisker<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
pump circulation which maintains the engine temperature
at a lower point. Consideration of the above will show
why the pump system is almost universally used in
connection with airplane power plant cooling.</p>

<h3><a name="SecVII_15" id="SecVII_15"></a>DIRECT AIR-COOLING METHODS</h3>

<p>The earliest known method of cooling the cylinder
of gas-engines was by means of a current of air passed
through a jacket which confined it close to the cylinder
walls and was used by Daimler on his first gas-engine.
The gasoline engine of that time was not as efficient as
the later form, and other conditions which materialized
made it desirable to cool the engine by water. Even as
gasoline engines became more and more perfected there
has always existed a prejudice against air cooling, though
many forms of engines have been used, both in automobile
and aircraft applications where the air-cooling method
has proven to be very practical.</p>

<p>The simplest system of air cooling is that in which
the cylinders are provided with a series of flanges which
increase the effective radiating surface of the cylinder
and directing an air-current from a fan against the
flanges to absorb the heat. This increase in the available
radiating surface of an air-cooled cylinder is necessary
because air does not absorb heat as readily as water
and therefore more surface must be provided that the
excess heat be absorbed sufficiently fast to prevent distortion
of the cylinders. Air-cooling systems are based
on a law formulated by Newton, which is: &#8220;The rate for
cooling for a body in a uniform current of air is directly
proportional to the speed of the air current and the
amount of radiating surface exposed to the cooling
effect.&#8221;</p>

<h3><a name="SecVII_16" id="SecVII_16"></a>AIR-COOLED ENGINE DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS</h3>

<p>There are certain considerations which must be taken
into account in designing an air-cooled engine, which are
often overlooked in those forms cooled by water. Large<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
valves must be provided to insure rapid expulsion of
the flaming exhaust gas and also to admit promptly the
fresh cool mixture from the carburetor. The valves of
air-cooled engines are usually placed in the cylinder-head,
in order to eliminate any pockets or sharp passages
which would impede the flow of gas or retain some of
the products of combustion and their heat. When high
power is desired multiple-cylinder engines should be used,
as there is a certain limit to the size of a successful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
air-cooled cylinder. Much better results are secured from
those having small cubical contents because the heat from
small quantities of gas will be more quickly carried off
than from greater amounts. All successful engines of
the aviation type which have been air-cooled have been
of the multiple-cylinder type.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="Fig085" id="Fig085"></a>
<img src="images/illo224.jpg" alt="Fig. 85" width="400" height="438" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 85.&mdash;Anzani Testing His Five-Cylinder Air Cooled Aviation Motor
Installed in Bleriot Monoplane. Note Exposure of Flanged Cylinders
to Propeller Slip Stream.</p></div>

<p>An air-cooled engine must be placed in the fuselage,
as at <a href="#Fig085">Fig. 85</a>, in such a way that there will be a positive
circulation of air around it all the time that it is in
operation. The air current may be produced by the
tractor screw at the front end of the motor, or by a
suction or blower fan attached to the crank-shaft as in the
Renault engine or by rotating the cylinders as in the
Le Rhone and Gnome motors. Greater care is required
in lubrication of the air-cooled cylinders and only the best
quality of oil should be used to insure satisfactory oiling.</p>

<p>The combustion chambers must be proportioned so
that distribution of metal is as uniform as possible in
order to prevent uneven expansion during increase in
temperature and uneven contraction when the cylinder
is cooled. It is essential that the inside walls of the
combustion chamber be as smooth as possible because
any sharp angle or projection may absorb sufficient heat
to remain incandescent and cause trouble by igniting the
mixture before the proper time. The best grades of cast
iron or steel should be used in the cylinder and piston
and the machine work must be done very accurately
so the piston will operate with minimum friction in the
cylinder. The cylinder bore should not exceed 4<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> or 5
inches and the compression pressure should never exceed
75 pounds absolute, or about five atmospheres, or serious
overheating will result.</p>

<p>As an example of the care taken in disposing of the
exhaust gases in order to obtain practical air-cooling,
some cylinders are provided with a series of auxiliary
exhaust ports uncovered by the piston when it reaches
the end of its power stroke. The auxiliary exhaust ports
open just as soon as the full force of the explosion has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
been spent and a portion of the flaming gases is discharged
through the ports in the bottom of the cylinder.
Less of the exhaust gases remains to be discharged
through the regular exhaust member in the cylinder-head
and this will not heat the walls of the cylinder nearly
as much as the larger quantity of hot gas would. That
the auxiliary exhaust port is of considerable value is
conceded by many designers of fixed and fan-shaped air-cooled
motors for airplanes.</p>

<p>Among the advantages stated for direct air cooling,
the greatest is the elimination of cooling water and its
cooling auxiliaries, which is a factor of some moment,
as it permits considerable reduction in horse-power-weight
ratio of the engine, something very much to be desired.
In the temperate zone, where the majority of airplanes
are used, the weather conditions change in a very few
months from the warm summer to the extreme cold
winter, and when water-cooled systems are employed it is
necessary to add some chemical substance to the water
to prevent it from freezing. The substances commonly
employed are glycerine, wood alcohol, or a saturated
solution of calcium chloride. Alcohol has the disadvantage
in that it vaporizes readily and must be often renewed.
Glycerine affects the rubber hose, while the
calcium chloride solution crystallizes and deposits salt
in the radiator and water pipes.</p>

<p>One of the disadvantages of an air-cooling method,
as stated by those who do not favor this system, is that
engines cooled by air cannot be operated for extended
periods under constant load or at very high speed without
heating up to such a point that premature ignition
of the charge may result. The water-cooling systems,
at the other hand, maintain the temperature of the engine
more nearly constant than is possible with an air-cooled
motor, and an engine cooled by water can be operated
under conditions of inferior lubrication or poor mixture
adjustment that would seriously interfere with proper
and efficient cooling by air.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>Air-cooled motors, as a rule, use less fuel than water-cooled
engines, because the higher temperature of the
cylinder does not permit of a full charge of gas being
inspired on the intake stroke. As special care is needed
in operating an air-cooled engine to obtain satisfactory
results and because of the greater difficulty which obtains
in providing proper lubrication and fuel mixtures which
will not produce undue heating, the air-cooled system
has but few adherents at the present time, and practically
all airplanes, with but very few exceptions, are provided
with water-cooled power plants. Those fitted with air-cooled
engines are usually short-flight types where maximum
lightness is desired in order to obtain high speed
and quick climb. The water-cooled engines are best
suited for airplanes intended for long flights. The Gnome,
Le Rhone and Clerget engines are thoroughly practical
and have been widely used in France and England.
These are rotary radial cylinder types. The Anzani is
a fixed cylinder engine used on training machines, while
the Renault is a V-type engine made in eight- and twelve-cylinder
V forms that has been used on reconnaissance
and bombing airplanes with success. These types will
be fully considered in proper sequence.</p>

<p>The improvements noted in the modern internal combustion
motors have been due to many conditions. The
continual experimenting by leading mechanical minds
could have but one ultimate result. The parts of the
engines have been lightened and strengthened, and greater
power has been obtained without increasing piston displacement.
A careful study has been made of the many
conditions which make for efficient motor action, and
that the main principles are well recognized by all engineers
is well shown by the standardization of design
noted in modern power plants. There are many different
methods of applying the same principle, and it will be
the purpose of this chapter to define the ways in which
the construction may be changed and still achieve the
same results. The various components may exist in many
different forms, and all have their advantages and disadvantages.
That all methods are practical is best shown
by the large number of successful engines which use
radically different designs.</p>

<h3><a name="SecVIII_1" id="SecVIII_1"></a>METHODS OF CYLINDER CONSTRUCTION</h3>

<p>One of the most important parts of the gasoline
engine and one that has material bearing upon its efficiency
is the cylinder unit. The cylinders may be cast<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
individually, or in pairs, and it is possible to make all
cylinders a unit or block casting. Some typical methods
of cylinder construction are shown in accompanying illustrations.
The appearance of individual cylinder castings
may be ascertained by examination of the Hall-Scott
airplane engine. Air-cooled engine cylinders are always
of the individual pattern.</p>

<p>Considered from a purely theoretical point of view,
the individual cylinder casting has much in its favor.
It is advanced that more uniform cooling is possible
than where the cylinders are cast either in pairs or three
or four in one casting. More uniform cooling insures
that the expansion or change of form due to heating will
be more equal. This is an important condition because
the cylinder bore must remain true under all conditions
of operation. If the heating effect is not uniform, which
condition is liable to obtain if metal is not evenly distributed,
the cylinder may become distorted by heat and
the bore be out of truth. When separate cylinders are
used it is possible to make a uniform water space and
have the cooling liquid evenly distributed around the
cylinder. In multiple cylinder castings this is not always
the rule, as in many instances, especially in four-cylinder
block motors where compactness is the main feature, there
is but little space between the cylinders for the passage
of water. Under such circumstances the cooling effect
is not even, and the stresses which obtain because of
unequal expansion may distort the cylinder to some
extent. When steel cylinders are made from forgings,
the water jackets are usually of copper or sheet steel
attached to the forging by autogenous welding; in the
case of the latter and, in some cases, the former may be
electro-deposited on the cylinders.</p>

<h3><a name="SecVIII_2" id="SecVIII_2"></a>BLOCK CASTINGS</h3>

<p>The advantage of casting the cylinders in blocks is
that a motor may be much shorter than it would be if
individual castings were used. It is admitted that when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
the cylinders are cast together a more compact, rigid,
and stronger power plant is obtained than when cast
separately. There is a disadvantage, however, in that
if one cylinder becomes damaged it will be necessary to
replace the entire unit, which means scrapping three
good cylinders because one of the four has failed. When
the cylinders are cast separately one need only replace
the one that has become damaged. The casting of four
cylinders in one unit is made possible by improved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
foundry methods, and when proper provision is made for
holding the cores when the metal is poured and the
cylinder casts are good, the construction is one of distinct
merit. It is sometimes the case that the proportion
of sound castings is less when cylinders are cast in
block, but if the proper precautions are observed in
molding and the proper mixtures of cast iron used, the
ratio of defective castings is no more than when cylinders
are molded individually. As an example of the courage
of engineers in departing from old-established rules, the
cylinder casting shown at <a href="#Fig086">Fig. 86</a> may be considered
typical. This is used on the Duesenberg four-cylinder
sixteen-valve <span class="nowrap">4<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>&#8242;&#8242;</span>
&times; <span class="nowrap">7&#8242;&#8242;</span> engine which has a piston displacement
of 496 cu. in. At a speed of 2,000 r.p.m.,
corresponding to a piston speed of 2,325 ft. per min., the
engine is guaranteed to develop 125 horse-power. The
weight of the model engine without gear reduction is
436 lbs., but a number of refinements have been made in
the design whereby it is expected to get the weight down
to 390 lbs. The four cylinders are cast from semi-steel
in a single block, with integral heads. The cylinder
construction is the same as that which has always
been used by Mr. Duesenberg, inlet and exhaust valves
being arranged horizontally opposite each other in the
head. There are large openings in the water jacket
at both sides and at the ends, which are closed by means
of aluminum covers, water-tightness being secured by
the use of gaskets. This results in a saving in weight
because the aluminum covers can be made considerably
lighter than it would be possible to cast the jacket walls,
and, besides, it permits of obtaining a more nearly uniform
thickness of cylinder wall, as the cores can be
much better supported. The cooling water passes completely
around each cylinder, and there is a very considerable
space between the two central cylinders, this
being made necessary in order to get the large bearing
area desirable for the central bearing.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="Fig086" id="Fig086"></a>
<img src="images/illo230.png" alt="Fig. 86" width="400" height="463" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 86.&mdash;Views of Four-Cylinder Duesenberg Airplane Engine
Cylinder Block.</p></div>

<p>It is common practice to cast the water jackets integral<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
with the cylinders, if cast iron or aluminum is used,
and this is also the most economical method of applying
it because it gives good results in practice. An important
detail is that the water spaces must be proportioned so
that they are equal around the cylinders whether these
members are cast individually, in pairs, threes or fours.
When cylinders are cast in block form it is good practice
to leave a large opening in the jacket wall which will
assist in supporting the core and make for uniform water
space. It will be noticed that the casting shown at <a href="#Fig086">Fig.
86</a> has a large opening in the side of the cylinder block.
These openings are closed after the interior of the casting
is thoroughly cleaned of all sand, core wire, etc., by brass,
cast iron or aluminum plates. These also have particular
value in that they may be removed after the motor has
been in use, thus permitting one to clean out the interior
of the water jacket and dispose of the rust, sediment,
and incrustation which are always present after the
engine has been in active service for a time.</p>

<p>Among the advantages claimed for the practice of
casting cylinders in blocks may be mentioned compactness,
lightness, rigidity, simplicity of water piping, as well
as permitting the use of simple forms of inlet and exhaust
manifolds. The light weight is not only due to the reduction
of the cylinder mass but because the block construction
permits one to lighten the entire motor. The fact
that all cylinders are cast together decreases vibration,
and as the construction is very rigid, disalignment of
working parts is practically eliminated. When inlet and
exhaust manifolds are cored in the block casting, as is
sometimes the case, but one joint is needed on each of
these instead of the multiplicity of joints which obtain
when the cylinders are individual castings. The water
piping is also simplified. In the case of a four-cylinder
block motor but two pipes are used; one for the water
to enter the cylinder jacket, the other for the cooling
liquid to discharge through.</p>

<h3><a name="SecVIII_3" id="SecVIII_3"></a>INFLUENCE ON CRANK-SHAFT DESIGN</h3>

<p>The method of casting the cylinders has a material
influence on the design of the crank-shaft as will be shown
in proper sequence. When four cylinders are combined
in one block it is possible to use a two-bearing crank-shaft.
Where cylinders are cast in pairs a three-bearing crank-shaft
is commonly supplied, and when cylinders are cast
as individual units it is thought necessary to supply a
five-bearing crank-shaft, though sometimes shafts having
but three journals are used successfully. Obviously the
shafts must be stronger and stiffer to withstand the
stresses imposed if two supporting bearings are used
than if a larger number are employed. In this connection
it may be stated that there is less difficulty in securing
alignment with a lesser number of bearings and there
is also less friction. On the other hand, the greater the
number of points of support a crank-shaft has the lighter
the webs can be made and still have requisite strength.</p>

<h3><a name="SecVIII_4" id="SecVIII_4"></a>COMBUSTION CHAMBER DESIGN</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="Fig087" id="Fig087"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 87.&mdash;Twin-Cylinder Block of Sturtevant Airplane Engine is Cast of
Aluminum, and Has Removable Cylinder Head.</p></div>

<p>Another point of importance in the design of the cylinder,
and one which has considerable influence upon the
power developed, is the shape of the combustion chamber.
The endeavor of designers is to obtain maximum power
from a cylinder of certain proportions, and the greater
energy obtained without increasing piston displacement
or fuel consumption the higher the efficiency of the motor.
To prevent troubles due to pre-ignition it is necessary
that the combustion chamber be made so that there will
be no roughness, sharp corners, or edges of metal which
may remain incandescent when heated or which will serve
to collect carbon deposits by providing a point of anchorage.
With the object of providing an absolutely clean
combustion chamber some makers use a separable head
unit to their twin cylinder castings, such as shown at
<a href="#Fig087">Fig. 87</a> and <a href="#Fig088">Fig. 88</a>. These permit one to machine the
entire interior of the cylinder and combustion chamber.
The relation of valve location and combustion chamber
design will be considered in proper sequence. These
cylinders are cast of aluminum, instead of cast iron, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
is customary, and are provided with steel or cast iron
cylinder liners forced in the soft metal casting bores.</p>

<h3><a name="SecVIII_5" id="SecVIII_5"></a>BORE AND STROKE RATIO</h3>

<p>A question that has been a vexed one and which has
been the subject of considerable controversy is the proper
proportion of the bore to the stroke. The early gas engines
had a certain well-defined bore to stroke ratio, as
it was usual at that time to make the stroke twice as long
as the bore was wide, but this cannot be done when high
speed is desired. With the development of the present-day
motor the stroke or piston travel has been gradually
shortened so that the relative proportions of bore and
stroke have become nearly equal. Of late there seems to
be a tendency among designers to return to the proportions
which formerly obtained, and the stroke is sometimes
one and a half or one and three-quarter times the
bore.</p>

<p>Engines designed for high speed should have the stroke
not much longer than the diameter of the bore. The disadvantage
of short-stroke engines is that they will not
pull well at low speeds, though they run with great regularity
and smoothness at high velocity. The long-stroke
engine is much superior for slow speed work, and it will
pull steadily and with increasing power at low speed.
It was formerly thought that such engines should never
turn more than a moderate number of revolutions, in
order not to exceed the safe piston speed of 1,000 feet
per minute. This old theory or rule of practice has been
discarded in designing high efficiency automobile racing
and aviation engines, and piston speeds from 2,500 to
3,000 feet per minute are sometimes used, though the
average is around 2,000 feet per minute. While both
short- and long-stroke motors have their advantages, it
would seem desirable to average between the two. That
is why a proportion of four to five or six seems to be
more general than that of four to seven or eight, which
would be a long-stroke ratio. Careful analysis of a number<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
of foreign aviation motors shows that the average
stroke is about 1.2 times the bore dimensions, though
some instances were noted where it was as high as 1.7
times the bore.</p>

<h3><a name="SecVIII_6" id="SecVIII_6"></a>MEANING OF PISTON SPEED</h3>

<p>The factor which limits the stroke and makes the
speed of rotation so dependent upon the travel of the
piston is piston speed. Lubrication is the main factor
which determines piston speed, and the higher the rate
of piston travel the greater care must be taken to insure
proper oiling. Let us fully consider what is meant by
piston speed.</p>

<p>Assume that a motor has a piston travel or stroke of
six inches, for the sake of illustration. It would take two
strokes of the piston to cover one foot, or twelve inches,
and as there are two strokes to a revolution it will be
seen that this permits of a normal speed of 1,000 revolutions
per minute for an engine with a six-inch stroke, if
one does not exceed 1,000 feet per minute. If the stroke
was only four inches, a normal speed of 1,500 revolutions
per minute would be possible without exceeding the prescribed
limit. The crank-shaft of a small engine, having
three-inch stroke, could turn at a speed of 2,000 revolutions
per minute without danger of exceeding the safe
speed limit. It will be seen that the longer the stroke
the slower the speed of the engine, if one desires to keep
the piston speed within the bounds as recommended, but
modern practice allows of greatly exceeding the speeds
formerly thought best.</p>

<h3><a name="SecVIII_7" id="SecVIII_7"></a>ADVANTAGES OF OFF-SET CYLINDERS</h3>

<p>Another point upon which considerable difference of
opinion exists relates to the method of placing the cylinder
upon the crank-case&mdash;i.e., whether its center line
should be placed directly over the center of the crank-shaft,
or to one side of center. The motor shown at
<a href="#Fig090">Fig. 90</a> is an off-set type, in that the center
line of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
cylinder is a little to one side of the center of the crank-shaft.
Diagrams are presented at <a href="#Fig091">Fig. 91</a> which show
the advantages of off-set crank-shaft construction. The
view at A is a section through a simple motor with the
conventional cylinder placing, the center line of both
crank-shaft and cylinder coinciding. The view at B shows<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
the cylinder placed to one side of center so that its center
line is distinct from that of the crank-shaft and at some
distance from it. The amount of off-set allowed is a point
of contention, the usual amount being from fifteen to
twenty-five per cent. of the stroke. The advantages of
the off-set are shown at <a href="#Fig091">Fig. 91</a>, C. If the crank turns
in direction of the arrow there is a certain resistance to
motion which is proportional to the amount of energy
exerted by the engine and the resistance offered by the
load. There are two thrusts acting against the cylinder
wall to be considered, that due to explosion or expansion
of the gas, and that which resists the motion of the piston.
These thrusts may be represented by arrows, one which
acts directly in a vertical direction on the piston top, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
other along a straight line through the center of the
connecting rod. Between these two thrusts one can draw
a line representing a resultant force which serves to bring
the piston in forcible contact with one side of the cylinder
wall, this being known as side thrust. As shown at C,
the crank-shaft is at 90 degrees, or about one-half stroke,
and the connecting rod is at 20 degrees angle. The
shorter connecting rod would increase the diagonal resultant
and side thrusts, while a longer one would reduce
the angle of the connecting rod and the side thrust of
the piston would be less. With the off-set construction,
as shown at D, it will be noticed that with the same connecting-rod
length as shown at C and with the crank-shaft
at 90 degrees of the circle that the connecting-rod
angle is 14 degrees and the side thrust is reduced proportionately.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="Fig090" id="Fig090"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 90.&mdash;Cross Section of Austro-Daimler Engine, Showing Offset Cylinder
Construction. Note Applied Water Jacket and Peculiar Valve Action.</p></div>

<p>Another important advantage is that greater efficiency
is obtained from the explosion with an off-set crank-shaft,
because the crank is already inclined when the piston is
at top center, and all the energy imparted to the piston
by the burning mixture can be exerted directly into producing
a useful turning effort. When a cylinder is placed
directly on a line with the crank-shaft, as shown at A,
it will be evident that some of the force produced by the
expansion of the gas will be exerted in a direct line and
until the crank moves the crank throw and connecting
rod are practically a solid member. The pressure which
might be employed in obtaining useful turning effort is
wasted by causing a direct pressure upon the lower half
of the main bearing and the upper half of the crank-pin
bushing.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 91.&mdash;Diagrams Demonstrating Advantages of Offset Crank-Shaft

<p>Very good and easily understood illustrations showing
advantages of the off-set construction are shown at
E and F. This is a bicycle crank-hanger. It is advanced
that the effort of the rider is not as well applied when
the crank is at position E as when it is at position F.
Position E corresponds to the position of the parts when
the cylinder is placed directly over the crank-shaft center.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
Position F may be compared to the condition which is
present when the off-set cylinder construction is used.</p>

<h3><a name="SecVIII_8" id="SecVIII_8"></a>VALVE LOCATION OF VITAL IMPORT</h3>

<p>It has often been said that a chain is no stronger than
its weakest link, and this is as true of the explosive motor
as it is of any other piece of mechanism. Many motors
which appeared to be excellently designed and which
were well constructed did not prove satisfactory because
some minor detail or part had not been properly considered
by the designer. A factor having material bearing
upon the efficiency of the internal combustion motor is
the location of the valves and the shape of the combustion
chamber which is largely influenced by their placing.
The fundamental consideration of valve design is that
the gases be admitted and discharged from the cylinder
as quickly as possible in order that the speed of gas flow
will not be impeded and produce back pressure. This is
imperative in obtaining satisfactory operation in any
form of motor. If the inlet passages are constricted the
cylinder will not fill with explosive mixture promptly,
whereas if the exhaust gases are not fully expelled the
parts of the inert products of combustion retained dilute
the fresh charge, making it slow burning and causing lost
power and overheating. When an engine employs water
as a cooling medium this substance will absorb the surplus
heat readily, and the effects of overheating are not
noticed as quickly as when air-cooled cylinders are employed.
Valve sizes have a decided bearing upon the
speed of motors and some valve locations permit the
use of larger members than do other positions.</p>

<p>While piston velocity is an important factor in determinations
of power output, it must be considered from
the aspect of the wear produced upon the various parts
of the motor. It is evident that engines which run very
fast, especially of high power, must be under a greater
strain than those operating at lower speeds. The valve-operating
mechanism is especially susceptible to the influence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
of rapid movement, and the slower the engine the
longer the parts will wear and the more reliable the
valve action.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="Fig092" id="Fig092"></a>

<p>As will be seen by reference to the accompanying illustration,
<a href="#Fig092">Fig. 92</a>, there are many ways in which valves may
be placed in the cylinder. Each method outlined possesses
some point of advantage, because all of the types<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
illustrated are used by reputable automobile manufacturers.
The method outlined at <a href="#Fig092">Fig. 92</a>, A, is widely
used, and because of its shape the cylinder is known as
the &#8220;T&#8221; form. It is approved for automobile use for
several reasons, the most important being that large
valves can be employed and a well-balanced and symmetrical
cylinder casting obtained. Two independent cam-shafts
are needed, one operating the inlet valves, the
other the exhaust members. The valve-operating mechanism
can be very simple in form, consisting of a plunger
actuated by the cam which transmits the cam motion to
the valve-stem, raising the valve as the cam follower
rides on the point of the cam. Piping may be placed
without crowding, and larger manifolds can be fitted than
in some other constructions. This has special value, as
it permits the use of an adequate discharge pipe on the
exhaust side with its obvious advantages. This method
of cylinder construction is never found on airplane engines
because it does not permit of maximum power
output.</p>

<p><a name="SecVIII_9" id="SecVIII_9"></a>On the other hand, if considered from a viewpoint of
actual heat efficiency, it is theoretically the worst form of
combustion chamber. This disadvantage is probably compensated
for by uniformity of expansion of the cylinder
because of balanced design. The ignition spark-plug may
be located directly over the inlet valve in the path of the
incoming fresh gases, and both valves may be easily removed
and inspected by unscrewing the valve caps without
taking off the manifolds.</p>

<p>The valve installation shown at C is somewhat unusual,
though it provides for the use of valves of large
diameter. Easy charging is insured because of the large
inlet valve directly in the top of the cylinder. Conditions
may be reversed if necessary, and the gases discharged
through this large valve. Both methods are used, though
it would seem that the free exhaust provided by allowing
the gases to escape directly from the combustion chamber
through the overhead valve to the exhaust manifold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
would make for more power. The method outlined at
<a href="#Fig092">Fig. 92</a>, F and at <a href="#Fig090">Fig. 90</a> is one that has been widely
employed on large automobile racing motors where extreme
power is required, as well as in engines constructed
for aviation service. The inclination of the valves permits
the use of large valves, and these open directly into
the combustion chamber. There are no pockets to retain
heat or dead gas, and free intake and outlet of gas is
obtained. This form is quite satisfactory from a theoretical
point of view because of the almost ideal combustion
chamber form. Some difficulty is experienced, however,
in properly water-jacketing the valve chamber which
experience has shown to be necessary if the engine is to
have high power.</p>

<p>The motor shown at <a href="#Fig092">Fig. 92</a>, B and <a href="#Fig088">Fig. 88</a> employs
cylinders of the &#8220;L&#8221; type. Both valves are placed in
a common extension from the combustion chamber, and
being located side by side both are actuated from a common
cam-shaft. The inlet and exhaust pipes may be
placed on the same side of the engine and a very compact
assemblage is obtained, though this is optional if
passages are cored in the cylinder pairs to lead the gases
to opposite sides. The valves may be easily removed
if desired, and the construction is fairly good from the
viewpoint of both foundry man and machinist. The chief
disadvantage is the limited area of the valves and the
loss of heat efficiency due to the pocket. This form of
combustion chamber, however, is more efficient than the
&#8220;T&#8221; head construction, though with the latter the use of
larger valves probably compensates for the greater heat
loss. It has been stated as an advantage of this construction
that both manifolds can be placed at the same
side of the engine and a compact assembly secured. On
the other hand, the disadvantage may be cited that in
order to put both pipes on the same side they must be
of smaller size than can be used when the valves are
oppositely placed. The &#8220;L&#8221; form cylinder is sometimes
made more efficient if but one valve is placed in the pocket<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
while the other is placed over it. This construction is
well shown at <a href="#Fig092">Fig. 92</a>, D and is found on Anzani motors.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="Fig093" id="Fig093"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 93.&mdash;Sectional View of Engine Cylinder Showing Valve and Cage
Installation.</p></div>

<p>The method of valve application shown at <a href="#Fig087">Fig. 87</a> is
an ingenious method of overcoming some of the disadvantages
inherent with valve-in-the-head motors. In the
first place it is possible to water-jacket the valves thoroughly,
which is difficult to accomplish when they are
mounted in cages. The water circulates directly around
the walls of the valve chambers, which is superior to a
construction where separate cages are used, as there are
two thicknesses of metal with the latter, that of the valve-cage
proper and the wall of the cylinder. The cooling
medium is in contact only with the outer wall, and as
there is always a loss of heat conductivity at a joint it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
is practically impossible to keep the exhaust valves and
their seats at a uniform temperature. The valves may
be of larger size without the use of pockets when seating
directly in the head. In fact, they could be equal in
diameter to almost half the bore of the cylinder, which
provides an ideal condition of charge placement and exhaust.
When valve grinding is necessary the entire head
is easily removed by taking off six nuts and loosening
inlet manifold connections, which operation would
be necessary even if cages were employed, as in the
engine shown at <a href="#Fig093">Fig. 93</a>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>At
<a href="#Fig094">Fig. 94</a>, A and B, a section through a typical &#8220;L&#8221;-shaped
cylinder is depicted. It will be evident that where
a pocket construction is employed, in addition to its faculty
for absorbing heat, the passage of gas would be
impeded. For example, the inlet gas rushing in through
the open valve would impinge sharply upon the valve-cap
or combustion head directly over the valve and then must
turn at a sharp angle to enter the combustion chamber<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
and then at another sharp angle to fill the cylinders. The
same conditions apply to the exhaust gases, though they
are reversed. When the valve-in-the-head type of cylinder
is employed, as at C, the only resistance offered the
gas is in the manifold. As far as the passage of the
gases in and out of the cylinder is concerned, ideal conditions
obtain. It is claimed that valve-in-the-head motors
are more flexible and responsive than other forms, but the
construction has the disadvantage in that the valves must
be opened through a rather complicated system of push
rods and rocker arms instead of the simpler and direct
plunger which can be used with either the &#8220;T&#8221; or &#8220;L&#8221;
head cylinders. This is clearly outlined in the illustrations
at <a href="#Fig095">Fig. 95</a>, where A shows the valve in the head-operating
mechanism necessary if the cam-shaft is carried
at the cylinder base, while B shows the most direct
push-rod action obtained with &#8220;T&#8221; or &#8220;L&#8221; head cylinder
placing.</p>

<p>The objection can be easily met by carrying the cam-shaft
above the cylinders and driving it by means of
gearing. The types of engine cylinders using this construction
are shown at <a href="#Fig096">Fig. 96</a>, and it will be evident that
a positive and direct valve action is possible by following
the construction originated by the Mercedes (German)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
aviation engine designers and outlined at A. The other
forms at B and C are very clearly adaptations of this
design. The Hall-Scott engine at <a href="#Fig097">Fig. 97</a> is depicted in
part section and no trouble will be experienced in understanding
the bevel pinion and gear drive from the crank-shaft<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
to the overhead cam-shaft through a vertical counter-shaft.
A very direct valve action is used in the
Duesenberg engines, one of which is shown in part section
at <a href="#Fig098">Fig. 98</a>. The valves are parallel with the piston top
and are actuated by rocker arms, one end of which bears
against the valve stem, and the other rides the cam-shaft.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 99.&mdash;Sectional Views Showing Arrangement of Novel Concentric Valve
Arrangement Devised by Panhard for Aerial Engines.</p></div>

<p>The form shown at <a href="#Fig099">Fig. 99</a> shows an ingenious application
of the valve-in-the-head idea which permits one
to obtain large valves. It has been used on some of the
Panhard aviation engines and on the American Aeromarine
power plants. The inlet passage is controlled
by the sliding sleeve which is hollow and slotted so as
to permit the inlet gases to enter the cylinder through
the regular type poppet valve which seats in the exhaust
sleeve. When the exhaust valve is operated by the tappet
rod and rocker arm the intake valve is also carried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
down with it. The intake gas passage is closed, however,
and the burned gases are discharged through the large
annular passage surrounding the sleeve. When the inlet
valve leaves its seat in the sleeve the passage of cool
gas around the sleeve keeps the temperature of both
valves to a low point and the danger of warping is minimized.
A dome-shaped combustion chamber may be used,
which is an ideal form in conserving heat efficiency, and
as large valves may be installed the flow of both fresh
and exhaust gases may be obtained with minimum resistance.
The intake valve is opened by a small auxiliary
rocker arm which is lifted when the cam follower rides
into the depression in the cam by the action of the strong
spring around the push rod. When the cam follower rides
on the high point the exhaust sleeve is depressed from
its seat against the cylinder. By using a cam having both
positive and negative profiles, a single rod suffices for
both valves because of its push and pull action.</p>

<h3><a name="SecVIII_10" id="SecVIII_10"></a>VALVE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION</h3>

<p>Valve dimensions are an important detail to be considered
and can be determined by several conditions,
among which may be cited method of installation, operating
mechanism, material employed, engine speed desired,
manner of cylinder cooling and degree of lift
desired. A review of various methods of valve location
has shown that when the valves are placed directly in
the head we can obtain the ideal cylinder form, though
larger valves may be used if housed in a separate pocket,
as afforded by the &#8220;T&#8221; head construction. The method
of operation has much to do with the size of the valves.
For example, if an automatic inlet valve is employed it
is good practice to limit the lift and obtain the required
area of port opening by augmenting the diameter. Because
of this a valve of the automatic type is usually
made twenty per cent. larger than one mechanically operated.
When both are actuated by cam mechanism, as is
now common practice, they are usually made the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
size and are interchangeable, which greatly simplifies
manufacture. The relation of valve diameter to cylinder
bore is one that has been discussed for some time
by engineers. The writer&#8217;s experience would indicate that
they should be at least half the bore, if possible. While
the mushroom type or poppet valve has become standard
and is the most widely used form at the present time,
there is some difference of opinion among designers as
to the materials employed and the angle of the seat. Most
valves have a bevel seat, though some have a flat seating.
The flat seat valve has the distinctive advantage of providing
a clear opening with lesser lift, this conducing to
free gas flow. It also has value because it is silent in
operation, but the disadvantage is present that best material
and workmanship must be used in their construction
to obtain satisfactory results. As it can be made very
light it is particularly well adapted for use as an automatic
inlet valve. Among other disadvantages cited is
the claim that it is more susceptible to derangement, owing
to the particles of foreign matter getting under the seat.
With a bevel seat it is argued that the foreign matter
would be more easily dislodged by the gas flow, and that
the valve would close tighter because it is drawn positively
against the bevel seat.</p>

<p>Several methods of valve construction are the vogue,
the most popular form being the one-piece type; those
which are composed of a head of one material and stem
of another are seldom used in airplane engines because
they are not reliable. In the built-up construction the
head is usually of high nickel steel or cast iron, which
metals possess good heat-resisting qualities. Heads made
of these materials are not likely to warp, scale, or pit,
as is sometimes the case when ordinary grades of machinery
steel are used. The cast-iron head construction
is not popular because it is often difficult to keep the head
tight on the stem. There is a slight difference in expansion
ratio between the head and the stem, and as the
stem is either screwed or riveted to the cast-iron head<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
the constant hammering of the valve against its seat may
loosen the joint. As soon as the head is loose on the stem
the action of the valve becomes erratic. The best practice
is to machine the valves from tungsten steel forgings.
This material has splendid heat-resisting qualities and
will not pit or become scored easily. Even the electrically
welded head to stem types which are used in automobile
engines are not looked upon with favor in the
aviation engine. Valve stem guides and valve stems must
be machined very accurately to insure correct action. The
usual practice in automobile engines is shown at <a href="#Fig100">Fig. 100</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="SecVIII_11" id="SecVIII_11"></a>VALVE OPERATION</h3>

<p>The methods of valve operation commonly used vary
according to the type of cylinder construction employed.
In all cases the valves are lifted from their seats by cam-actuated
mechanism. Various forms of valve-lifting cams
are shown at <a href="#Fig101">Fig. 101</a>. As will be seen,
a cam consists<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
of a circle to which a raised, approximately triangular
member has been added at one point. When the cam
follower rides on the circle, as shown at <a href="#Fig102">Fig. 102</a>, there
is no difference in height between the cam center and its
periphery and there is no movement of the plunger. As
soon as the raised portion of the cam strikes the plunger
it will lift it, and this reciprocating movement is transmitted
to the valve stem by suitable mechanical connections.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;"><a name="Fig101" id="Fig101"></a>

Profile for Long Dwell and Quick Lift. B&mdash;Typical Inlet Cam Used
with Mushroom Type Follower. C&mdash;Average Form of Cam. D&mdash;Designed
to Give Quick Lift and Gradual Closing.</p></div>

<p>The cam forms outlined at <a href="#Fig101">Fig. 101</a> are those commonly
used. That at A is used on engines where it is
desired to obtain a quick lift and to keep the valve fully
opened as long as possible. It is a noisy form, however,
and is not very widely employed. That at B is utilized
more often as an inlet cam while the profile shown at C
is generally depended on to operate exhaust valves. The
cam shown at D is a composite form which has some
of the features of the other three types. It will give the
quick opening of form A, the gradual closing of form B,
and the time of maximum valve opening provided by cam
profile C.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="Fig102" id="Fig102"></a>
<img src="images/illo255.png" alt="Fig. 102" width="500" height="316" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 102.&mdash;Showing Principal Types of Cam Followers which Have Received
General Application.</p></div>

<p>The various types of valve plungers used are shown
at <a href="#Fig102">Fig. 102</a>. That shown at A is the simplest form, consisting
of a simple cylindrical member having a rounded
end which follows the cam profile. These are sometimes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
made of square stock or kept from rotating by means of
a key or pin. A line contact is possible when the plunger
is kept from turning, whereas but a single point bearing
is obtained when the plunger is cylindrical and free to
revolve. The plunger shown at A will follow only cam
profiles which have gradual lifts. The plunger shown at
B is left free to revolve in the guide bushing and is provided
with a flat mushroom head which serves as a cam
follower. The type shown at C carries a roller at its
lower end and may follow very irregular cam profiles if
abrupt lifts are desired. While forms A and B are the
simplest, that outlined at C in its various forms is more
widely used. Compound plungers are used on the Curtiss
OX-2 motors, one inside the other. The small or inner one
works on a cam of conventional design, the outer plunger
follows a profile having a flat spot to permit of a pull
rod action instead of a push rod action. All the methods
in which levers are used to operate valves are more or
less noisy because clearance must be left between the valve
stem and the stop of the plunger. The space must be
taken up before the valve will leave its seat, and when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
the engine is operated at high speeds the forcible contact
between the plunger and valve stem produces a rattling
sound until the valves become heated and expand and the
stems lengthen out. Clearance must be left between the
valve stems and actuating means. This clearance is clearly
shown in <a href="#Fig103">Fig. 103</a> and should be <span class="nowrap">.020&#8242;&#8242;</span> (twenty thousandths)
when engine is cold. The amount of clearance
allowed depends entirely upon the design of the engine
and length of valve stem. On the Curtiss OX-2 engines
the clearance is but <span class="nowrap">.010&#8242;&#8242;</span> (ten thousandths) because the
valve stems are shorter. Too little clearance will result
in loss of power or misfiring when engine is hot. Too
much clearance will not allow the valve to open its full
amount and will disturb the timing.</p>

<h3><a name="SecVIII_12" id="SecVIII_12"></a>METHODS OF DRIVING CAM-SHAFT</h3>

<p>Two systems of cam-shaft operation are used. The
most common of these is by means of gearing of some
form. If the cam-shaft is at right angles to the crank-shaft
it may be driven by worm, spiral, or bevel gearing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
If the cam-shaft is parallel to the crank-shaft, simple spur
gear or chain connection may be used to turn it. A typical
cam-shaft for an eight-cylinder V engine is shown at
<a href="#Fig104">Fig. 104</a>. It will be seen that the sixteen cams are forged
integrally with the shaft and that it is spur-gear driven.
The cam-shaft drive of the Hall-Scott motor is shown at
<a href="#Fig097">Fig. 97</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;"><a name="Fig104" id="Fig104"></a>
<img src="images/illo257.jpg" alt="Fig. 104" width="550" height="201" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 104.&mdash;Cam-Shaft of Thomas Airplane Motor Has Cams Forged Integral.
Note Split Cam-Shaft Bearings and Method of Gear Retention.</p></div>

<p>While gearing is more commonly used, considerable
attention has been directed of late to silent chains for
cam-shaft operation. The ordinary forms of block or
roller chain have not proven successful in this application,
but the silent chain, which is in reality a link belt
operating over toothed pulleys, has demonstrated its
worth. The tendency to its use is more noted on foreign
motors than those of American design. It first came to
public notice when employed on the Daimler-Knight engine
for driving the small auxiliary crank-shafts which
reciprocated the sleeve valves. The advantages cited for
the application of chains are, first, silent operation, which
obtains even after the chains have worn considerably;
second, in designing it is not necessary to figure on maintaining
certain absolute center distances between the
crank-shaft and cam-shaft sprockets, as would be the case
if conventional forms of gearing were used. On some
forms of motor employing gears, three and even four<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
members are needed to turn the cam-shaft. With a chain
drive but two sprockets are necessary, the chain forming
a flexible connection which permits the driving and driven
members to be placed at any distance apart that the
exigencies of the design demand. When chains are used
it is advised that some means for compensating chain
slack be provided, or the valve timing will lag when
chains are worn. Many combination drives may be
worked out with chains that would not be possible with
other forms of gearing. Direct gear drive is favored at
the present time by airplane engine designers because they
are the most certain and positive means, even when a
number of gears must be used as intermediate drive
members. With overhead cam-shafts, bevel gears work
out very well in practice, as in the Hall-Scott motors and
others of that type.</p>

<h3><a name="SecVIII_13" id="SecVIII_13"></a>VALVE SPRINGS</h3>

<p>Another consideration of importance is the use of
proper valve-springs, and particular care should be taken
with those, of automatic valves. The spring must be weak
enough to allow the valve to open when the suction is
light, and must be of sufficient strength to close it in
time at high speeds. It should be made as large as possible
in diameter and with a large number of convolutions,
in order that fatigue of the metal be obviated, and it is
imperative that all springs be of the same strength when
used on a multiple-cylinder engine. Practically all valves
used to control the gas flow in airplane engines are mechanically
operated. On the exhaust valve the spring
must be strong enough so that the valve will not be sucked
in on the inlet stroke. It should be borne in mind that
if the spring is too strong a strain will be imposed on
the valve-operating mechanism, and a hammering action
produced which may cause deformation of the valve-seat.
Only pressure enough to insure that the operating mechanism
will follow the cam is required. It is common
practice to make the inlet and exhaust valve springs of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
the same tension when the valves are of the same size
and both mechanically operated. This is done merely to
simplify manufacture and not because it is necessary for
the inlet valve-spring to be as strong as the other. Valve
springs of the helical coil type are generally used, though
torsion or &#8220;scissors&#8221; springs and laminated or single-leaf
springs are also utilized in special applications. Two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
springs are used on each valve in some valve-in-the-head
types; a spring of small pitch diameter inside the regular
valve-spring and concentric with it. Its function is to
keep the valve from falling into the cylinder in event of
breakage of the main spring in some cases, and to provide
a stronger return action in others.</p>

<h3>KNIGHT SLIDE VALVE MOTOR</h3>

<p>The sectional view through the cylinder at <a href="#Fig105">Fig. 105</a>
shows the Knight sliding sleeves and their actuating
means very clearly. The diagrams at <a href="#Fig106">Fig. 106</a> show
graphically the sleeve movements and their relation to
the crank-shaft and piston travel. The action may be
summed up as follows: The inlet port begins to open
when the lower edge of the opening of the outside sleeve
which is moving down passes the top of the slot in the
inner member also moving downwardly. The inlet port
is closed when the lower edge of the slot in the inner
sleeve which is moving up passes the top edge of the port
in the outer sleeve which is also moving toward the top
of the cylinder. The inlet opening extends over two hundred
degrees of crank motion. The exhaust port is uncovered
slightly when the lower edge of the port in the
inner sleeve which is moving down passes the lower edge
of the portion of the cylinder head which protrudes in
the cylinder. When the top of the port in the outer sleeve
traveling toward the bottom of the cylinder passes the
lower edge of the slot in the cylinder wall the exhaust
passage is closed. The exhaust opening extends over a
period corresponding to about two hundred and forty
degrees of crank motion. The Knight motor has not been
applied to aircraft to the writer&#8217;s knowledge, but an
eight-cylinder Vee design that might be useful in that
connection if lightened is shown at <a href="#Fig107">Fig. 107</a>. The main
object is to show that the Knight valve action is the only
other besides the mushroom or poppet valve that has been
applied successfully to high speed gasoline engines.</p>

<h3><a name="SecVIII_14" id="SecVIII_14"></a>VALVE TIMING</h3>

<p>It is in valve timing that the greatest difference of
opinion prevails among engineers, and it is rare that one
will see the same formula in different motors. It is true
that the same timing could not be used with motors of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
different construction, as there are many factors which
determine the amount of lead to be given to the valves.
The most important of these is the relative size of the
valve to the cylinder bore, the speed of rotation it is
desired to obtain, the fuel efficiency, the location of the
valves, and other factors too numerous to mention.</p>

<p>Most of the readers should be familiar with the cycle
of operation of the internal combustion motor of the
four-stroke type, and it seems unnecessary to go into
detail except to present a review. The first stroke of the
piston is one in which a charge of gas is taken into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
motor; the second stroke, which is in reverse direction
to the first, is a compression stroke, at the end of which
the spark takes place, exploding the charge and driving
the piston down on the third or expansion stroke, which
is in the same direction as the intake stroke, and finally,
after the piston has nearly reached the end of this stroke,
another valve opens to allow the burned gases to escape,
and remains open until the piston has reached the end
of the fourth stroke and is in a position to begin the
series over again. The ends of the strokes are reached
when the piston comes to a stop at either top or bottom
of the cylinder and reverses its motion. That point is
known as a center, and there are two for each cylinder,
top and bottom centers, respectively.</p>

<p>All circles may be divided into 360 parts, each of
which is known as a degree, and, in turn, each of these
degrees may be again divided into minutes and seconds,
though we need not concern ourselves with anything less
than the degree. Each stroke of the piston represents
180 degrees travel of the crank, because two strokes represent
one complete revolution of three hundred and sixty
degrees. The top and bottom centers are therefore separated
by 180 degrees. Theoretically each phase of a
four-cycle engine begins and ends at a center, though in
actual practice the inertia or movement of the gases
makes it necessary to allow a lead or lag to the valve, as
the case may be. If a valve opens before a center, the
distance is called &#8220;lead&#8221;; if it closes after a center, this
distance is known as &#8220;lag.&#8221; The profile of the cams
ordinarily used to open or close the valves represents a
considerable time in relation to the 180 degrees of the
crank-shaft travel, and the area of the passages through
which the gases are admitted or exhausted is quite small
owing to the necessity of having to open or close the
valves at stated times; therefore, to open an adequately
large passage for the gases it is necessary to open the
valves earlier and close them later than at centers.</p>

<p>That advancing the opening of the exhaust valve was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
of value was discovered on the early motors and is explained
by the necessity of releasing a large amount of
gas, the volume of which has been greatly raised by the
heat of combustion. When the inlet valves were mechanically
operated it was found that allowing them to lag
at closing enabled the inspiration of a greater volume of
gas. Disregarding the inertia or flow of the gases, opening
the exhaust at center would enable one to obtain full
value of the expanding gases the entire length of the
piston stroke, and it would not be necessary to keep the
valve open after the top center, as the reverse stroke
would produce a suction effect which might draw some
of the inert charge back into the cylinder. On the other
hand, giving full consideration to the inertia of the gas,
opening the valve before center is reached will provide
for quick expulsion of the gases, which have sufficient
velocity at the end of the stroke, so that if the valve is
allowed to remain open a little longer, the amount of lag
varying with the opinions of the designer, the cylinder
is cleared in a more thorough manner.</p>

<h3><a name="SecVIII_15" id="SecVIII_15"></a>BLOWING BACK</h3>

<p>When the factor of retarded opening is considered
without reckoning the inertia of the gases, it would
appear that if the valve were allowed to remain open
after center had passed, say, on the closing of the inlet,
the piston, having reversed its motion, would have the
effect of expelling part of the fresh charge through the
still open valve as it passed inward at its compression
stroke. This effect is called blowing back, and is often
noted with motors where the valve settings are not absolutely
correct, or where the valve-springs or seats are
defective and prevent proper closing.</p>

<p>This factor is not of as much import as might appear,
as on closer consideration it will be seen that the movement
of the piston as the crank reaches either end of the
stroke is less per degree of angular movement than it
is when the angle of the connecting rod is greater. Then,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
again, a certain length of time is required for the reversal
of motion of the piston, during which time the crank is
in motion but the piston practically at a standstill. If the
valves are allowed to remain open during this period,
the passage of the gas in or out of the cylinder will be
by its own momentum.</p>

<h3><a name="SecVIII_16" id="SecVIII_16"></a>LEAD GIVEN EXHAUST VALVE</h3>

<p>The faster a motor turns, all other things being equal,
the greater the amount of lead or advance it is necessary
to give the opening of the exhaust valve. It is self-evident
truth that if the speed of a motor is doubled it
travels twice as many degrees in the time necessary to
lower the pressure. As most designers are cognizant of
this fact, the valves are proportioned accordingly. It is
well to consider in this respect that the cam profile has
much to do with the manner in which the valve is opened;
that is, the lift may be abrupt and the gas allowed to
escape in a body, or the opening may be gradual, the
gas issuing from the cylinder in thin streams. An analogy
may be made with the opening of any bottle which contains
liquid highly carbonated. If the cork is removed
suddenly the gas escapes with a loud pop, but, on the
other hand, if the bottle is uncorked gradually, the gas
escapes from the receptacle in thin streams around the
cork, and passage of the gases to the air is accomplished
without noise. While the second plan is not harsh, it
is slower than the former, as must be evident.</p>

<h3><a name="SecVIII_17" id="SecVIII_17"></a>EXHAUST CLOSING, INLET OPENING</h3>

<p>A point which has been much discussed by engineers
is the proper relation of the closing of the exhaust valve
and the opening of the inlet. Theoretically they should
succeed each other, the exhaust closing at upper dead
center and the inlet opening immediately afterward. The
reason why a certain amount of lag is given the exhaust
closing in practice is that the piston cannot drive the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
gases out of the cylinder unless they are compressed to
a degree in excess of that existing in the manifold or
passages, and while toward the end of the stroke this
pressure may be feeble, it is nevertheless indispensable.
At the end of the piston&#8217;s stroke, as marked by the upper
dead center, this compression still exists, no matter how
little it may be, so that if the exhaust valve is closed and
the inlet opened immediately afterward, the pressure
which exists in the cylinder may retard the entrance of
the fresh gas and a certain portion of the inert gas may
penetrate into the manifold. As the piston immediately
begins to aspirate, this may not be serious, but as these
gases are drawn back into the cylinder the fresh charge
will be diluted and weakened in value. If the spark-plug
is in a pocket, the points may be surrounded by this weak
gas, and the explosion will not be nearly as energetic as
when the ignition spark takes place in pure mixture.</p>

<p>It is a well-known fact that the exhaust valve should
close after dead center and that a certain amount of lag
should be given to opening of the inlet. The lag given
the closing of the exhaust valve should not be as great
as that given the closing of the inlet valve. Assuming
that the excess pressure of the exhaust will equal the
depression during aspiration, the time necessary to complete
the emptying of the cylinder will be proportional
to the volume of the gas within it. At the end of the
suction stroke the volume of gas contained in the cylinder
is equal to the cylindrical volume plus the space of the
combustion chamber. At the end of the exhaust stroke
the volume is but that of the dead space, and from one-third
to one-fifth its volume before compression. While
it is natural to assume that this excess of burned gas
will escape faster than the fresh gas will enter the cylinder,
it will be seen that if the inlet valve were allowed
to lag twenty degrees, the exhaust valve lag need not be
more than five degrees, providing that the capacity of
the combustion chamber was such that the gases occupied
one-quarter of their former volume.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>It is evident that no absolute rule can be given, as
back pressure will vary with the design of the valve
passages, the manifolds, and the construction of the
muffler. The more direct the opening, the sooner the
valve can be closed and the better the cylinder cleared.
Ten degrees represent an appreciable angle of the crank,
and the time required for the crank to cover this angular
motion is not inconsiderable and an important quantity of
the exhaust may escape, but the piston is very close to
the dead center after the distance has been covered.</p>

<p>Before the inlet valve opens there should be a certain
depression in the cylinder, and considerable lag may be
allowed before the depression is appreciable. So far as
the volume of fresh gas introduced during the admission
stroke is concerned, this is determined by the displacement
of the piston between the point where the inlet valve
opens and the point of closing, assuming that sufficient
gas has been inspired so that an equilibrium of pressure
has been established between the interior of the cylinder
and the outer air. The point of inlet opening varies with
different motors. It would appear that a fair amount of
lag would be fifteen degrees past top center for the inlet
opening, as a certain depression will exist in the cylinder,
assuming that the exhaust valve has closed five or ten
degrees after center, and at the same time the piston has
not gone down far enough on its stroke to materially
decrease the amount of gas which will be taken into the
cylinder.</p>

<h3><a name="SecVIII_18" id="SecVIII_18"></a>CLOSING THE INLET VALVE</h3>

<p>As in the case with the other points of opening and
closing, there is a wide diversity of practice as relates
to closing the inlet valve. Some of the designers close
this exactly at bottom center, but this practice cannot
be commended, as there is a considerable portion of time,
at least ten or fifteen degrees angular motion of the crank,
before the piston will commence to travel to any extent
on its compression stroke. The gases rushing into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
cylinder have considerable velocity, and unless an equilibrium
is obtained between the pressure inside and that
of the atmosphere outside, they will continue to rush into
the cylinder even after the piston ceases to exert any
suction effect.</p>

<p>For this reason, if the valve is closed exactly on center,
a full charge may not be inspired into the cylinder,
though if the time of closing is delayed, this momentum
or inertia of the gas will be enough to insure that a
maximum charge is taken into the cylinder. The writer
considers that nothing will be gained if the valve is allowed
to remain open longer than twenty degrees, and an
analysis of practice in this respect would seem to confirm
this opinion. From that point in the crank movement
the piston travel increases and the compressive effect is
appreciable, and it would appear that a considerable proportion
of the charge might be exhausted into the manifold
and carburetor if the valve were allowed to remain
open beyond a point corresponding to twenty degrees
angular movement of the crank.</p>

<h3><a name="SecVIII_19" id="SecVIII_19"></a>TIME OF IGNITION</h3>

<p>In this country engineers unite in providing a variable
time of ignition, though abroad some difference of
opinion is noted on this point. The practice of advancing
the time of ignition, when affected electrically, was
severely condemned by early makers, these maintaining
that it was necessary because of insufficient heat and
volume of the spark, and it was thought that advancing
ignition was injurious. The engineers of to-day appreciate
the fact that the heat of the electric spark, especially
when from a mechanical generator of electrical
energy, is the only means by which we can obtain practically
instantaneous explosion, as required by the operation
of motors at high speeds, and for the combustion
of large volumes of gas.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 108.&mdash;Diagrams Explaining Valve and Ignition Timing of Hall-Scott

<p>It is apparent that a motor with a fixed point of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
ignition is not as desirable, in every way, as one in which
the ignition can be advanced to best meet different requirements,
and the writer does not readily perceive any
advantage outside of simplicity of control in establishing
a fixed point of ignition. In fact, there seems to be some
difference of opinion among those designers who favor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
fixed ignition, and in one case this is located forty-three
degrees ahead of center, and in another motor the point
is fixed at twenty degrees, so that it may be said that
this will vary as much as one hundred per cent. in various
forms. This point will vary with different methods of
ignition, as well as the location of the spark-plug or
igniter. For the sake of simplicity, most airplane engines
use set spark; if an advancing and retarding mechanism
is fitted, it is only to facilitate starting, as the
spark is kept advanced while in flight, and control is by
throttle alone.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 109.&mdash;Timing Diagram of Typical Six-Cylinder Engine.</p></div>

<p>It is obvious by consideration of the foregoing that
there can be no arbitrary rules established for timing,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
because of the many conditions which determine the best
times for opening and closing the valves. It is customary
to try various settings when a new motor is designed
until the most satisfactory points are determined, and
the setting which will be very suitable for one motor is
not always right for one of different design. The timing
diagram shown at <a href="#Fig108">Fig. 108</a> applies to the Hall-Scott
engine, and may be considered typical. It should be
easily followed in view of the very complete explanation
given in preceding pages. Another six-cylinder engine
diagram is shown at <a href="#Fig109">Fig. 109</a>, and an eight-cylinder timing
diagram is shown at <a href="#Fig110">Fig. 110</a>. In timing automobile
engines no trouble is experienced, because timing marks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
are always indicated on the engine fly-wheel register with
an indicating trammel on the crank-case. To time an
airplane engine accurately, as is necessary to test for a
suspected cam-shaft defect, a timing disc of aluminum is
attached to the crank-shaft which has the timing marks
indicated thereon. If the disc is made 10 or 12 inches
in diameter, it may be divided into degrees without
difficulty.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="Fig110" id="Fig110"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 110.&mdash;Timing Diagram of Typical Eight-Cylinder V Engine.</p></div>

<h3><a name="SecVIII_20" id="SecVIII_20"></a>HOW AN ENGINE IS TIMED</h3>

<p>In timing a motor from the marks on the timing disc
rim it is necessary to regulate the valves of but one
cylinder at a time. Assuming that the disc is revolving
in the direction of engine rotation, and that the firing
order of the cylinders is 1-3-4-2, the operation of timing
would be carried on as follows: The crank-shaft would
be revolved until the line marked &#8220;Exhaust opens 1 and
4&#8221; registered with the trammel on the motor bed. At this
point the exhaust-valve of either cylinder No. 1 or No. 4
should begin to open. This can be easily determined by
noting which of these cylinders holds the compressed
charge ready for ignition. Assuming that the spark has
occurred in cylinder No. 1, then when the fly-wheel is
turned from the position to that in which the line marked
&#8220;Exhaust opens 1 and 4&#8221; coincides with the trammel
point, the valve-plunger under the exhaust-valve of cylinder
No. 1 should be adjusted in such a way that there is
no clearance between it and the valve stem. Further
movement of the wheel in the same direction should produce
a lift of the exhaust valve. The disc is turned about
two hundred and twenty-five degrees, or a little less than
three-quarters of a revolution; then the line marked
&#8220;Exhaust closes 1 and 4&#8221; will register with the trammel
point. At this period the valve-plunger and the valve-stem
should separate and a certain amount of clearance
obtain between them. The next cylinder to time would
be No. 3. The crank-shaft is rotated until mark &#8220;Exhaust
opens 2 and 3&#8221; comes in line with the trammel. At this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
point the exhaust valve of cylinder No. 3 should be just
about opening. The closing is determined by rotating the
shaft until the line &#8220;Exhaust closes 2 and 3&#8221; comes
under the trammel.</p>

<p>This operation is carried on with all the cylinders,
it being well to remember that but one cylinder is working
at a time and that a half-revolution of the fly-wheel
corresponds to a full working stroke of all the cylinders,
and that while one is exhausting the others are respectively
taking in a new charge, compressing and exploding.
For instance, if cylinder No. 1 has just completed its
power-stroke, the piston in cylinder No. 3 has reached
the point where the gas may be ignited to advantage.
The piston of cylinder No. 4, which is next to fire, is at
the bottom of its stroke and will have inspired a charge,
while cylinder No. 2, which is the last to fire, will have
just finished expelling a charge of burned gas, and will
be starting the intake stroke. This timing relates to a
four-cylinder engine in order to simplify the explanation.
The timing instructions given apply only to the conventional
motor types. Rotary cylinder engines, especially
the Gnome &#8220;monosoupape,&#8221; have a distinctive valve
timing on account of the peculiarities of design.</p>

<h3><a name="SecVIII_21" id="SecVIII_21"></a>GNOME &#8220;MONOSOUPAPE&#8221; VALVE TIMING</h3>

<p>In the present design of the Gnome motor, a cycle of
operations somewhat different from that employed in the
ordinary four-cycle engine is made use of, says a writer
in &#8220;The Automobile,&#8221; in describing the action of this
power-plant. This cycle does away with the need for the
usual inlet valve and makes the engine operable with only
a single valve, hence the name <i>monosoupape</i>, or &#8220;single-valve.&#8221;
The cycle is as follows: A charge being compressed
in the outer end of the cylinder or combustion
chamber, it is ignited by a spark produced by the spark-plug
located in the side of this chamber, and the burning
charge expands as the piston moves down in the cylinder
while the latter revolves around the crank-shaft. When<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
the piston is about half-way down on the power stroke,
the exhaust valve, which is located in the center of the
cylinder-head, is mechanically opened, and during the
following upstroke of the piston the burnt gases are
expelled from the cylinder through the exhaust valve
directly into the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Instead of closing at the end of the exhaust stroke,
or a few degrees thereafter, the exhaust valve is held
open for about two-thirds of the following inlet stroke
of the piston, with the result that fresh air is drawn
through the exhaust valve into the cylinder. When the
cylinder is still 65 degrees from the end of the inlet half-revolution,
the exhaust valve closes. As no more air
can get into the cylinder, and as the piston continues to
move inwardly, it is obvious that a partial vacuum is
formed.</p>

<p>When the cylinder approaches within 20 degrees of
the end of the inlet half-revolution a series of small
inlet ports all around the circumference of the cylinder
wall is uncovered by the top edge of the piston, whereby
the combustion chamber is placed in communication with
the crank chamber. As the pressure in the crank chamber
is substantially atmospheric and that in the combustion
chamber is below atmospheric, there results a suction
effect which causes the air from the crank chamber to
flow into the combustion chamber. The air in the crank
chamber is heavily charged with gasoline vapor, which
is due to the fact that a spray nozzle connected with the
gasoline supply tank is located inside the chamber. The
proportion of gasoline vapor in the air in the crank
chamber is several times as great as in the ordinary
combustible mixture drawn from a carburetor into the
cylinder. This extra-rich mixture is diluted in the combustion
chamber with the air which entered it through
the exhaust valve during the first part of the inlet stroke,
thus forming a mixture of the proper proportion for
complete combustion.</p>

<p>The inlet ports in the cylinder wall remain open until<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
20 degrees of the compression half-revolution has been
completed, and from that moment to near the end of the
compression stroke the gases are compressed in the
cylinder. Near the end of the stroke ignition takes place
and this completes the cycle.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="Fig111" id="Fig111"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 111.&mdash;Timing Diagram Showing Peculiar Valve Timing of Gnome
&#8220;Monosoupape&#8221; Rotary Motor.</p></div>

<p>The exact timing of the different phases of the cycle
is shown in the diagram at <a href="#Fig111">Fig. 111</a>. It will be seen that
ignition occurs substantially 20 degrees ahead of the
outer dead center, and expansion of the burning gases
continues until 85 degrees past the outer dead center,
when the piston is a little past half-stroke. Then the
exhaust-valve opens and remains open for somewhat
more than a complete revolution of the cylinders, or, to
be exact, for 390 degrees of cylinder travel, until 115
degrees past the top dead center on the second revolution.
Then for 45 degrees of travel the charge within the
cylinder is expanded, whereupon the inlet ports are uncovered
and remain open for 40 degrees of cylinder
travel, 20 degrees on each side of the inward dead center
position.</p>

<h3><a name="SecVIII_22" id="SecVIII_22"></a>SPRINGLESS VALVES</h3>

<p>Springless valves are the latest development on French
racing car engines, and it is possible that the positively-operated
types will be introduced on aviation engines
also. Two makes of positively-actuated valves are shown
at <a href="#Fig112">Fig. 112</a>. The positive-valve motor differs from the conventional
form by having no necessity for valve-springs,
as a cam not only assures the opening of the valve, but
also causes it to return to the valve-seat. In this respect
it is much like the sleeve-valve motor, where the uncovering
of the ports is absolutely positive. The cars equipped
with these valves were a success in long-distance auto
races. Claims made for this type of valve mechanism
include the possibility of a higher number of revolutions
and consequently greater engine power. With the spring-controlled,
single-cam operated valve a point is reached
where the spring is not capable of returning the valve<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
to its seat before the cam has again begun its opening
movement. It is possible to extend the limits considerably
by using a light valve on a strong spring, but the
valve still remains a limiting factor in the speed of the
motor.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="Fig112" id="Fig112"></a>
<img src="images/illo277.png" alt="Fig. 112" width="500" height="414" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 112.&mdash;Two Methods of Operating Valves by Positive Cam Mechanism
Which Closes as Well as Opens Them.</p></div>

<p>A part sectional view through a cylinder of an engine
designed by G. Michaux is shown at <a href="#Fig112">Fig. 112</a>, A. There
are two valves per cylinder, inclined at about ten degrees
from the vertical. The valve-stems are of large diameter,
as owing to positive control, there is no necessity of
lightening this part in an unusual degree. A single overhead<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
cam-shaft has eight pairs of cams, which are shown
in detail at B. For each valve there is a three-armed
rocker, one arm of which is connected to the stem of the
valve and the two others are in contact respectively with
the opening and closing cams. The connection to the
end of the valve-stem is made by a short connecting link,
which is screwed on to the end of the valve-stem and
locked in position. This allows some adjustment to be
made between the valves and the actuating rocker. It will
be evident that one cam and one rocker arm produce
the opening of the valve and that the corresponding
rocker arm and cam result in the closing of the valve.
If the opening cam has the usual convex profile, the closing
cam has a correspondingly concave profile. It will
be noticed that a light valve-spring is shown in drawing.
This is provided to give a final seating to its valve after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
it has been closed by the cam. This is not absolutely
necessary, as an engine has been run successfully without
these springs. The whole mechanism is contained
within an overhead aluminum cover.</p>

<p>The positive-valve system used on the De Lage motor
is shown at D. In this the valves are actuated as shown
in sectional views D and E. The valve system is unique
in that four valves are provided per cylinder, two for
exhaust and two for intake. The valves are mounted
side by side, as shown at E, so the double actuator member
may be operated by a single set of cams. The valve-operating
member consists of a yoke having guide bars
at the top and bottom. The actuating cam works inside
of this yoke. The usual form of cam acts on the lower
portion of the yoke to open the valve, while the concave
cam acts on the upper part to close the valves. In this
design provision is made for expansion of the valve-stems
due to heat, and these are not positively connected to the
actuating member. As shown at E, the valves are held
against the seat by short coil springs at the upper end
of the stem. These are very stiff and are only intended
to provide for expansion. A slight space is left between
the top of the valve-stem and the portion of the operating
member that bears against them when the regular
profile cam exerts its pressure on the bottom of the valve-operating
mechanism. Another novelty in this motor
design is that the cam-shafts and the valve-operating
members are carried in casing attached above the motor
by housing supports in the form of small steel pillars.
The overhead cam-shafts are operated by means of bevel
gearing.</p>

<h3><a name="SecVIII_23" id="SecVIII_23"></a>FOUR VALVES PER CYLINDER</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="Fig113" id="Fig113"></a>
<img src="images/illo279.png" alt="Fig. 113" width="450" height="349" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 113.&mdash;Diagram Comparing Two Large Valves and Four Small Ones
of Practically the Same Area. Note How Easily Small Valves are
Installed to Open Directly Into the Cylinder.</p></div>

<p>Mention has been previously made of the sixteen-valve
four-cylinder Duesenberg motor and its great power
output for the piston displacement. This is made possible
by the superior volumetric efficiency of a motor
provided with four valves in each cylinder instead of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
but two. This principle was thoroughly tried out in racing
automobile motors, and is especially valuable in permitting
of greater speed and power output from simple
four- and six-cylinder engines. On eight- and twelve-cylinder
types, it is doubtful if the resulting complication
due to using a very large number of valves would
be worth while. When extremely large valves are used,
as shown in diagram at <a href="#Fig113">Fig. 113</a>, it is difficult to have
them open directly into the cylinder, and pockets are
sometimes necessary. A large valve would weigh more
than two smaller valves having an area slightly larger
in the aggregate; it would require a stiffer valve spring
on account of its greater weight. A certain amount of
metal in the valve-head is necessary to prevent warping;
therefore, the inertia forces will be greater in the large
valve than in the two smaller valves. As a greater port<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285"></a></span>
area is obtained by the use of two valves, the gases will
be drawn into the cylinder or expelled faster than with
a lesser area. Even if the areas are practically the same
as in the diagram at <a href="#Fig113">Fig. 113</a>, the smaller valves may
have a greater lift without imposing greater stresses on
the valve-operating mechanism and quicker gas intake
and exhaust obtained. The smaller valves are not affected
by heat as much as larger ones are. The quicker
gas movements made possible, as well as reduction of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
inertia forces, permits of higher rotative speed, and,
consequently, greater power output for a given piston
displacement. The drawings at <a href="#Fig114">Fig. 114</a> show a sixteen-valve
motor of the four-cylinder type that has been designed
for automobile racing purposes, and it is apparent
that very slight modifications would make it suitable for
aviation purposes. Part of the efficiency is due to the
reduction of bearing friction by the use of ball bearings,
but the multiple-valve feature is primarily responsible
for the excellent performance.</p>

<h3><a name="SecIX_1" id="SecIX_1"></a>CONSTRUCTIONAL DETAILS OF PISTONS</h3>

<p>The piston is one of the most important parts of the
gasoline motor inasmuch as it is the reciprocating member
that receives the impact of the explosion and which
transforms the power obtained by the combustion of gas
to mechanical motion by means of the connecting rod to
which it is attached. The piston is one of the simplest
elements of the motor, and it is one component which
does not vary much in form in different types of motors.
The piston is a cylindrical member provided with a series
of grooves in which packing rings are placed on the outside
and two bosses which serve to hold the wrist pin in
its interior. It is usually made of cast iron or aluminum,
though in some motors where extreme lightness is desired,
such as those used for a&euml;ronautic work, it may be
made of steel. The use of the more resisting material
enables the engineer to use lighter sections where it is
important that the weight of this member be kept as low
as possible consistent with strength.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="Fig116" id="Fig116"></a>

<p>A number of piston types are shown at <a href="#Fig116">Fig. 116</a>. That
at A has a round top and is provided with four split
packing rings and two oil grooves. A piston of this type
is generally employed in motors where the combustion
chamber is large and where it is desired to obtain a
higher degree of compression than would be possible with
a flat top piston. This construction is also stronger because
of the arched piston top. The most common form<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
of piston is that shown at B, and it differs from that
previously described only in that it has a flat top. The
piston outlined in section at C is a type used on some
of the sleeve-valve motors of the Knight pattern, and
has a concave head instead of the convex form shown
at A. The design shown at D in side and plan views is
the conventional form employed in two-cycle engines.
The deflector plate on the top of the cylinder is cast integral
and is utilized to prevent the incoming fresh gases
from flowing directly over the piston top and out of the
exhaust port, which is usually opposite the inlet opening.
On these types of two-cycle engines where a two-diameter
cylinder is employed, the piston shown at E is<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a></span>
used. This is known as a &#8220;differential piston,&#8221; and has
an enlarged portion at its lower end which fits the pumping
cylinder. The usual form of deflector plate is provided
at the top of the piston and one may consider it
as two pistons in one.</p>

<p>One of the important conditions in piston design is
the method of securing the wrist pin which is used to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
connect the piston to the upper end of the connecting
rod. Various methods have been devised to keep the
pin in place, the most common of these being shown at
<a href="#Fig117">Fig. 117</a>. The wrist pin should be retained by some
positive means which is not liable to become loose under
the vibratory stresses which obtain at this point. If the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
wrist pin was free to move it would work out of the
bosses enough so that the end would bear against the
cylinder wall. As it is usually made of steel, which is a
harder material than cast iron used in cylinder construction,
the rubbing action would tend to cut a groove in
the cylinder wall which would make for loss of power
because it would permit escape of gas. The wrist pin
member is a simple cylindrical element that fits the bosses
closely, and it may be either hollow or solid stock. A
typical piston and connecting rod assembly which shows
a piston in section also is given at <a href="#Fig118">Fig. 118</a>. The piston
of the Sturtevant a&euml;ronautical motor is shown at <a href="#Fig119">Fig.

<p>The method of retention shown at A is the simplest
and consists of a set screw having a projecting portion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
passing into the wrist pin and holding it in place. The
screw is kept from turning or loosening by means of a
check nut. The method outlined at B is similar to that
shown at A, except that the wrist pin is solid and the
point of the set screw engages an annular groove turned
in the pin for its reception. A very positive method is
shown at C. Here the retention screws pass into the
wrist pin and are then locked by a piece of steel wire
which passes through suitable holes in the ends. The
method outlined at D is sometimes employed, and it varies
from that shown at C only in that the locking wire, which
is made of spring steel, is passed through the heads of
the locking screws. Some designers machine a large
groove around the piston at such a point that when the
wrist pin is put in place a large packing ring may be
sprung in the groove and utilized to hold the wrist pin
in place.</p>

<p>The system shown at F is not so widely used as the
simpler methods, because it is more costly and does not
offer any greater security when the parts are new than
the simple lock shown at A. In this a hollow wrist pin is
used, having a tapered thread cut at each end. The wrist
pin is slotted at three or four points, for a distance equal
to the length of the boss, and when taper expansion plugs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
are screwed in place the ends of the wrist pin are expanded
against the bosses. This method has the advantage
of providing a certain degree of adjustment if the
wrist pin should loosen up after it has been in use for
some time. The taper plugs would be screwed in deeper
and the ends of the wrist pin expanded proportionately
to take up the loss motion. The method shown at G is
an ingenious one. One of the piston bosses is provided
with a projection which is drilled out to receive a plunger.
The wrist pin is provided with a hole of sufficient size to
receive the plunger, which is kept in place by means of
a spring in back of it. This makes a very positive lock
and one that can be easily loosened when it is desired to
remove the wrist pin. To unlock, a piece of fine rod is
thrust into the hole at the bottom of the boss which pushes
the plunger back against the spring until the wrist pin
can be pushed out of the piston.</p>

<p>Some engineers think it advisable to oscillate the wrist
pin in the piston bosses, instead of in the connecting rod
small end. It is argued that this construction gives more
bearing surface at the wrist pin and also provides for
more strength because of the longer bosses that can be
used. When this system is followed the piston pin is
held in place by locking it to the connecting rod by some
means. At H the simplest method is outlined. This consisted
of driving a taper pin through both rod and wrist
pin and then preventing it from backing out by putting
a split cotter through the small end of the tapered locking
pin. Another method, which is depicted at I, consists
of clamping the wrist pin by means of a suitable bolt
which brings the slit connecting rod end together as
shown.</p>

<h3><a name="SecIX_2" id="SecIX_2"></a>ALUMINUM FOR CYLINDERS AND PISTONS</h3>

<p>Aluminum pistons outlined at <a href="#Fig122">Fig. 122</a>, have replaced
cast iron members in many airplane engines, as these
weigh about one-third as much as the cast iron forms of
the same size, while the reduction in the inertia forces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
has made it possible to increase the engine speed without
correspondingly stressing the connecting rods, crank-shaft
and engine bearings.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="Fig122" id="Fig122"></a>
<img src="images/illo291.png" alt="Fig. 122" width="450" height="335" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 122.&mdash;Types of Aluminum Pistons Used In Aviation Engines.</p></div>

<p>Aluminum has not only been used for pistons, but a
number of motors will be built for the coming season that
will use aluminum cylinder block castings as well. Of
course, the aluminum alloy is too soft to be used as a
bearing for the piston, and it will not withstand the hammering
action of the valve. This makes the use of cast
iron or steel imperative in all motors. When used in connection
with an aluminum cylinder block the cast iron
pieces are placed in the mould so that they act as cylinder
liners and valve seats, and the molten metal is poured
around them when the cylinder is cast. It is said that
this construction results in an intimate bond between the
cast iron and the surrounding aluminum metal. Steel
liners may also be pressed into the aluminum cylinders
after these are bored out to receive them. Aluminum
has for a number of years been used in many motor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
car parts. Alloys have been developed that have greater
strength than cast iron and that are not so brittle. Its
use for manifolds and engine crank and gear cases has
been general for a number of years.</p>

<p>At first thought it would seem as though aluminum
would be entirely unsuited for use in those portions of
internal combustion engines exposed to the heat of the
explosion, on account of the low melting point of that
metal and its disadvantageous quality of suddenly &#8220;wilting&#8221;
when a critical point in the temperature is reached.
Those who hesitated to use aluminum on account of this
defect lost sight of the great heat conductivity of that
metal, which is considerably more than that of cast iron.
It was found in early experiments with aluminum pistons
that this quality of quick radiation meant that aluminum
pistons remained considerably cooler than cast iron ones
in service, which was attested to by the reduced formation
of carbon deposit thereon. The use of aluminum
makes possible a marked reduction in power plant weight.
A small four-cylinder engine which was not particularly
heavy even with cast iron cylinders was found to weigh
100 pounds less when the cylinder block, pistons, and
upper half of the crank-case had been made of aluminum
instead of cast iron. Aluminum motors are no longer
an experiment, as a considerable number of these have
been in use on cars during the past year without the
owners of the cars being apprised of the fact. Absolutely
no complaint was made in any case of the aluminum
motor and it was demonstrated, in addition to the saving
in weight, that the motors cost no more to assemble and
cooled much more efficiently than the cast iron form. One
of the drawbacks to the use of aluminum is its growing
scarcity, which results in making it a &#8220;near precious&#8221;
metal.</p>

<h3><a name="SecIX_3" id="SecIX_3"></a>PISTON RING CONSTRUCTION</h3>

<p>As all pistons must be free to move up and down in
the cylinder with minimum friction, they must be less in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
diameter than the bore of the cylinder. The amount of
freedom or clearance provided varies with the construction
of the engine and the material the piston is made of,
as well as its size, but it is usual to provide from .005 to
.010 of an inch to compensate for the expansion of the
piston due to heat and also to leave sufficient clearance
for the introduction of lubricant between the working
surfaces. Obviously, if the piston were not provided with
packing rings, this amount of clearance would enable a
portion of the gases evolved when the charge is exploded
to escape by it into the engine crank-case. The packing
members or piston rings, as they are called, are split
rings of cast iron, which are sprung into suitable grooves
machined on the exterior of the piston, three or four of
these being the usual number supplied. These have sufficient
elasticity so that they bear tightly against the cylinder
wall and thus make a gas-tight joint. Owing to the
limited amount of surface in contact with the cylinder
wall and the elasticity of the split rings the amount of
friction resulting from the contact of properly fitted rings
and the cylinder is not of enough moment to cause any
damage and the piston is free to slide up and down in
the cylinder bore.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="Fig123" id="Fig123"></a>
<img src="images/illo293.png" alt="Fig. 123" width="450" height="169" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 123.&mdash;Types of Piston Rings and Ring Joints. A&mdash;Concentric Ring.
B&mdash;Eccentrically Machined Form. C&mdash;Lap Joint Ring. D&mdash;Butt Joint,
Seldom Used. E&mdash;Diagonal Cut Member, a Popular Form.</p></div>

<p>These rings are made in two forms, as outlined at
<a href="#Fig123">Fig. 123</a>. The design shown at A is termed a
&#8220;concentric<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
ring,&#8221; because the inner circle is concentric with the
outer one and the ring is of uniform thickness at all
points. The ring shown at B is called an &#8220;eccentric
ring,&#8221; and it is thicker at one part than at others. It
has theoretical advantages in that it will make a tighter
joint than the other form, as it is claimed its expansion
due to heat is more uniform. The piston rings must be
split in order that they may be sprung in place in the
grooves, and also to insure that they will have sufficient
elasticity to take the form of the cylinder at the different
points in their travel. If the cylinder bore varies by
small amounts the rings will spring out at the points
where the bore is larger than standard, and spring in at
those portions where it is smaller than standard.</p>

<p>It is important that the joint should be as nearly gas-tight
as possible, because if it were not a portion of the
gases would escape through the slots in the piston rings.
The joint shown at C is termed a &#8220;lap joint,&#8221; because
the ends of the ring are cut in such a manner that they
overlap. This is the approved joint. The butt joint
shown at D is seldom used and is a very poor form, the
only advantage being its cheapness. The diagonal cut
shown at E is a compromise between the very good form
shown at C and the poor joint depicted at D. It is also
widely used, though most constructors prefer the lap
joint, because it does not permit the leakage of gas as
much as the other two types.</p>

<p>There seems to be some difference of opinion relative
to the best piston ring type&mdash;some favoring the eccentric
pattern, others the concentric form. The concentric ring
has advantages from the lubricating engineer&#8217;s point of
view; as stated by the Platt &amp; Washburn Company in
their text-book on engine lubrication, the smaller clearance
behind the ring possible with the ring of uniform
section is advantageous.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig124">Fig. 124</a>, A, shows a concentric piston ring in its
groove. Since the ring itself is concentric with the
groove, very small clearance between the back of the ring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
and the bottom of its groove may be allowed. Small
clearance leaves less space for the accumulation of oil
and carbon deposits. The gasket effect of this ring is
uniform throughout the entire length of its edges, which
is its marked advantage over the eccentric ring. This
type of piston ring rarely burns fast in its groove. There
are a large number of different concentric rings manufactured
of different designs and of different efficiency.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="Fig124" id="Fig124"></a>
<img src="images/illo295.png" alt="Fig. 124" width="500" height="254" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 124.&mdash;Diagrams Showing Advantages of Concentric Piston Rings.</p></div>

<p><a href="#Fig124">Figs. 124</a>, B and <a href="#Fig124">124</a>, C show eccentric rings assembled
in the ring groove. It will be noted that there is a large
space between the thin ends of this ring and the bottom
of the groove. This empty space fills up with oil which
in the case of the upper ring frequently is carbonized,
restricting the action of the ring and nullifying its usefulness.
The edges of the thin ends are not sufficiently
wide to prevent rapid escape of gases past them. In a
practical way this leakage means loss of compression and
noticeable drop in power. When new and properly fitted,
very little difference can be noted between the tightness
of eccentric and concentric rings. Nevertheless, after
several months&#8217; use, a more rapid leakage will always
occur past the eccentric than past the concentric. If
continuous trouble with the carbonization of cylinders,
smoking and sooting of spark-plugs is experienced, it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
a sure indication that mechanical defects exist in the engine,
assuming of course, that a suitable oil has been
used. Such trouble can be greatly lessened, if not entirely
eliminated, by the application of concentric rings
(lap joint), of any good make, properly fitted into the
grooves of the piston. Too much emphasis cannot be
put upon this point. If the oil used in the engine is of
the correct viscosity, and serious carbon deposit, smoking,
etc., still result, the only certain remedy then is to have
the cylinders rebored and fitted with properly designed,
oversized pistons and piston rings.</p>

<h3><a name="SecIX_4" id="SecIX_4"></a>LEAK-PROOF PISTON RINGS</h3>

<p>In order to reduce the compression loss and leakage
of gas by the ordinary simple form of diagonal or lap
joint one-piece piston ring a number of compound rings
have been devised and are offered by their makers to
use in making replacements. The leading forms are
shown at <a href="#Fig125">Fig. 125</a>. That shown at A is known as the
&#8220;Statite&#8221; and consists of three rings, one carried inside
while the other two are carried on the outside. The ring
shown at B is a double ring and is known as the McCadden.
This is composed of two thin concentric lap joint
rings so disposed relative to each other that the opening
in the inner ring comes opposite to the opening in the
outer ring.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="Fig125" id="Fig125"></a>
<img src="images/illo297.png" alt="Fig. 125" width="500" height="348" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 125.&mdash;Leak-Proof and Other Compound Piston Rings.</p></div>

<p>The form shown at C is known as the &#8220;Leektite,&#8221;
and is a single ring provided with a peculiar form of lap
and dove tail joint. The ring shown at D is known as
the &#8220;Dunham&#8221; and is of the double concentric type being
composed of two rings with lap joints which are welded
together at a point opposite the joint so that there is no
passage by which the gas can escape. The Burd high
compression ring is shown at E. The joints of these
rings are sealed by means of an H-shaped coupler of
bronze which closes the opening. The ring ends are made
with tongues which interlock with the coupling. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
ring shown at F is called the &#8220;Evertite&#8221; and is a three-piece
ring composed of three members as shown in the
sectional view below the ring. The main part or inner
ring has a circumferential channel in which the two outer
rings lock, the resulting cross-section being rectangular
just the same as that of a regular pattern ring. All
three rings are diagonally split and the joints are spaced
equally and the distances maintained by small pins. This
results in each joint being sealed by the solid portion of
the other rings.</p>

<p>The use of a number of light steel rings instead of
one wide ring in the groove is found on a number of
automobile power plants, but as far as known, this construction
is not used in airplane power plants. It is
contended that where a number of light rings is employed
a more flexible packing means is obtained and the
possibility of leakage is reduced. Rings of this design
are made of square section steel wire and are given a
spring temper. Owing to the limited width the diagonal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
cut joint is generally employed instead of the lap joint
which is so popular on wider rings.</p>

<h3><a name="SecIX_5" id="SecIX_5"></a>KEEPING OIL OUT OF COMBUSTION CHAMBERS</h3>

<p>An examination of the engine design that is economical
in oil consumption discloses the use of tight piston
rings, large centrifugal rings on the crank-shaft where it
passes through the case, ample cooling fins in the pistons,
vents between the crank-case chamber and the valve enclosures,
etc. Briefly put, cooling of the oil in this engine
has been properly cared for and leakage reduced to a
minimum. To be specific regarding details of design:
Oil surplus can be kept out of the explosion chambers by
leaving the lower edge of the piston skirt sharp and by
the use of a shallow groove (C), <a href="#Fig126">Fig. 126</a>, just below the
lower piston ring. Small holes are bored through the
piston walls at the base of this groove and communicate
with the crank-case. The similarity of the sharp edges
of piston skirt (D) and piston ring to a carpenter&#8217;s plane
bit, makes their operation plain.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="Fig126" id="Fig126"></a>
<img src="images/illo299.png" alt="Fig. 126" width="400" height="462" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 126.&mdash;Sectional View of Engine Showing Means of Preventing
Oil Leakage By Piston Rings.</p></div>

<p>The cooling of oil in the sump (A) can be accomplished
most effectively by radiating fins on its outer
surface. The lower crank-case should be fully exposed to
the outer air. A settling basin for sediment (B) should
be provided having a cubic content not less than one-tenth
of the total oil capacity as outlined at <a href="#Fig126">Fig. 126</a>.
The depth of this basin should be at least 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches, and
its walls vertical, as shown, to reduce the mixing of sediment
with the oil in circulation. The inlet opening to
the oil pump should be near the top of the sediment basin
in order to prevent the entrance into the pump with the
oil of any solid matter or water condensed from the products
of combustion. This sediment basin should be
drained after every five to seven hours air service of an
airplane engine. Concerning filtering screens there is
little to be said, save that their areas should be ample
and the mesh coarse enough (one-sixteenth of an inch) to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
offer no serious resistance to the free flow of cold or
heavy oil through them; otherwise the oil in the crank-case
may build up above them to an undesirable level.
The necessary frequency of draining and flushing out the
oil sump differs greatly with the age (condition) of the
engine and the suitability of the oil used. In broad terms,
the oil sump of a new engine should be thoroughly drained
and flushed with kerosene at the end of the first 200<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
miles, next at the end of 500 miles and thereafter every
1,000 miles. While these instructions apply specifically
to automobile motors, it is very good practice to change
the oil in airplane engines frequently. In many cases,
the best results have been secured when the oil supply
is completely replenished every five hours that the engine
is in operation.</p>

<h3><a name="SecIX_6" id="SecIX_6"></a>CONNECTING ROD FORMS</h3>

<p>The connecting rod is the simple member that joins
the piston to the crank-shaft and which transmits the
power imparted to the piston by the explosion so that it
may be usefully applied. It transforms the reciprocating
movement of the piston to a rotary motion at the crank-shaft.
A typical connecting rod and its wrist pin are
shown at <a href="#Fig120">Fig. 120</a>. It will be seen that it has two bearings,
one at either end. The small end is bored out to
receive the wrist pin which joins it to the piston, while
the large end has a hole of sufficient size to go on the
crank-pin. The airplane and automobile engine connecting
rod is invariably a steel forging, though in marine
engines it is sometimes made a steel or high tensile
strength bronze casting. In all cases it is desirable to
have softer metals than the crank-shaft and wrist pin at
the bearing point, and for this reason the connecting rod
is usually provided with bushings of anti-friction or white
metal at the lower end, and bronze at the upper. The
upper end of the connecting rod may be one piece, because
the wrist pin can be introduced after it is in place
between the bosses of the piston. The lower bearing
must be made in two parts in most cases, because the
crank-shaft cannot be passed through the bearing owing
to its irregular form. The rods of the Gnome engine are
all one piece types, as shown at <a href="#Fig127">Fig. 127</a>, owing to the
construction of the &#8220;mother&#8221; rod which receives the
crank-pins. The complete connecting rod assembly is
shown in <a href="#Fig121">Fig. 121</a>, also at A, <a href="#Fig127">Fig. 127</a>.
The &#8220;mother<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>&#8221;
rod, with one of the other rods in place and one about
to be inserted, is shown at <a href="#Fig127">Fig. 127</a>, B. The built-up
crank-shaft which makes this construction feasible is
shown at <a href="#Fig127">Fig. 127</a>, C.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="Fig127" id="Fig127"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 127.&mdash;Connecting Rod and Crank-Shaft Construction of Gnome
&#8220;Monosoupape&#8221; Engine.</p></div>

<p>Some of the various designs of connecting rods that
have been used are shown at <a href="#Fig128">Fig. 128</a>. That at A is a
simple form often employed in single-cylinder motors,
having built-up crank-shafts. Both ends of the connecting
rod are bushed with a one-piece bearing, as it can
be assembled in place before the crank-shaft assembly is
built up. A built-up crank-shaft such as this type of connecting
rod would be used with is shown at <a href="#Fig106">Fig. 106</a>. The
pattern shown at B is one that has been used to some
extent on heavy work, and is known as the &#8220;marine
type.&#8221; It is made in three pieces, the main portion being
a steel forging having a flanged lower end to which the
bronze boxes are secured by bolts. The modified marine
type depicted at C is the form that has received the widest
application in automobile and aviation engine construction.<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307"></a></span>
It consists of two pieces, the main member
being a steel drop forging having the wrist-pin bearing
and the upper crank-pin bearing formed integral, while
the lower crank-pin bearing member is a separate forging
secured to the connecting rod by bolts. In this construction
bushings of anti-friction metal are used at the
lower end, and a bronze bushing is forced into the upper- or
wrist-pin end. The rod shown at D has also been
widely used. It is similar in construction to the form
shown at C, except that the upper end is split in order
to permit of a degree of adjustment of the wrist-pin
bushing, and the lower bearing cap is a hinged member
which is retained by one bolt instead of two. When it is
desired to assemble it on the crank-shaft the lower cap
is swung to one side and brought back into place when
the connecting rod has been properly located. Sometimes
the lower bearing member is split diagonally instead of
horizontally, such a construction being outlined at E.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;"><a name="Fig128" id="Fig128"></a>

G&mdash;Sections Showing Structural Shapes Commonly Employed in Connecting Rod Construction.</p></div>

<p>In a number of instances, instead of plain bushed
bearings anti-friction forms using ball or rollers have
been used at the lower end. A ball-bearing connecting
rod is shown at F. The big end may be made in one
piece, because if it is possible to get the ball bearing on
the crank-pins it will be easy to put the connecting rod
in place. Ball bearings are not used very often on connecting
rod big ends because of difficulty of installation,
though when applied properly they give satisfactory service
and reduce friction to a minimum. One of the advantages
of the ball bearing is that it requires no adjustment,
whereas the plain bushings depicted in the other
connecting rods must be taken up from time to time to
compensate for wear.</p>

<p>This can be done in forms shown at B, C, D, and E
by bringing the lower bearing caps closer to the upper
one and scraping out the brasses to fit the shaft. A
number of liners or shims of thin brass or copper stock,
varying from .002 inch to .005 inch, are sometimes interposed
between the halves of the bearings when it is first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
fitted to the crank-pin. As the brasses wear the shims
may be removed and the portions of the bearings brought
close enough together to take up any lost motion that
may exist, though in some motors no shims are provided
and depreciation can be remedied only by installing new
brasses and scraping to fit.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 129.&mdash;Double Connecting Rod Assembly For Use On Single Crank-Pin

<p>The various structural shapes in which connecting rods
are formed are shown in section at G. Of these the I
section is most widely used in airplane engines, because
it is strong and a very easy shape to form by the drop-forging
process or to machine out of the solid bar when
extra good steel is used. Where extreme lightness is
desired, as in small high-speed motors used for cycle propulsion,
the section shown at the extreme left is often
used. If the rod is a cast member as in some marine engines,
the cross, hollow cylinder, or U sections are sometimes
used. If the sections shown at the right are employed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
advantage is often taken of the opportunity for
passing lubricant through the center of the hollow round
section on vertical motors or at the bottom of the U
section, which would be used on a horizontal cylinder
power plant.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 130.&mdash;Another Type of Double Connecting Rod for Vee Engines.</p></div>

<p><a name="SecIX_7" id="SecIX_7"></a>Connecting rods of Vee engines are made in two distinct
styles. The forked or &#8220;scissors&#8221; joint rod assembly
is employed when the cylinders are placed directly opposite
each other. The &#8220;blade&#8221; rod, as shown at <a href="#Fig129">Fig.
129</a>, fits between the lower ends of the forked rod, which
oscillate on the bearing which encircles the crank-pin.
The lower end of the &#8220;blade&#8221; rod is usually attached to
the bearing brasses, the ends of the &#8220;forked&#8221; rod move
on the outer surfaces of the brasses. Another form of
rod devised for use under these conditions is shown at
<a href="#Fig130">Fig. 130</a> and installed in an aviation engine at <a href="#Fig132">Fig. 132</a>.
In this construction the shorter rod is attached to a boss
on the master rod by a short pin to form a hinge and to
permit the short rod to oscillate as the conditions dictate.<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"></a></span>
This form of rod can be easily adjusted when the
bearing depreciates, a procedure that is difficult with the
forked type rod. The best practice, in the writer&#8217;s opinion,
is to stagger the cylinders and use side-by-side rods
as is done in the Curtiss engine. Each rod may be fitted
independently of the other and perfect compensation for
wear of the big ends is possible.</p>

<h3><a name="SecIX_8" id="SecIX_8"></a>CAM-SHAFT AND CRANK-SHAFT DESIGN</h3>

<p>Before going extensively into the subject of crank-shaft
construction it will be well to consider cam-shaft
design, which is properly a part of the valve system and
which has been considered in connection with the other
elements which have to do directly with cylinder construction
to some extent. Cam-shafts are usually simple members
carried at the base of the cylinder in the engine
case of Vee type motors by suitable bearings and having
the cams employed to lift the valves attached at intervals.
A typical cam-shaft design is shown at <a href="#Fig133">Fig. 133</a>. Two
main methods of cam-shaft construction are followed&mdash;that
in which the cams are separate members, keyed and
pinned to the shaft, and the other where the cams are
formed integral, the latter being the most suitable for
airplane engine requirements.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a name="Fig133" id="Fig133"></a>
<img src="images/illo308.jpg" alt="Fig. 133" width="600" height="156" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 133.&mdash;Typical Cam-Shaft, with Valve Lifting Cams and Gears to
Operate Auxiliary Devices Forged Integrally.</p></div>

<p>The cam-shafts shown at <a href="#Fig133">Figs. 133</a> and <a href="#Fig134">134</a>, B, are of
the latter type, as the cams are machined integrally. In
this case not only the cams but also the gears used in
driving the auxiliary shafts are forged integral. This is
a more expensive construction, because of the high initial
cost of forging dies as well as the greater expense of
machining. It has the advantage over the other form in
which the cams are keyed in place in that it is stronger,
and as the cams are a part of the shaft they can never
become loose, as might be possible where they are separately
formed and assembled on a simple shaft.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="Fig134" id="Fig134"></a>

<p>The importance of the crank-shaft has been previously<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
considered, and some of its forms have been shown in
views of the motors presented in earlier portions of this
work. The crank-shaft is one of the parts subjected to
the greatest strain and extreme care is needed in its construction
and design, because practically the entire duty
of transmitting the power generated by the motor to the
gearset devolves upon it. Crank-shafts are usually made
of high tensile strength steel of special composition. They
may be made in four ways, the most common being from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
a drop or machine forging which is formed approximately
to the shape of the finished shaft and in rare instances
(experimental motors only) they may be steel castings.
Sometimes they are made from machine forgings, where
considerably more machine work is necessary than would
be the case where the shaft is formed between dies.
Some engineers favor blocking the shaft out of a solid
slab of metal and then machining this rough blank to
form. In some radial-cylinder motors of the Gnome and
Le Rhone type the crank-shafts are built up of two pieces,
held together by taper fastenings or bolts.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a name="Fig135" id="Fig135"></a>
<img src="images/illo310.png" alt="Fig. 135" width="600" height="232" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 135.&mdash;Showing Method of Making Crank-Shaft. A&mdash;The Rough Steel
Forging Before Machining. B&mdash;The Finished Six-Throw, Seven-Bearing
Crank-Shaft.</p></div>

<p>The form of the shaft depends on the number of
cylinders and the form has material influence on the
method of construction. For instance, a four-cylinder
crank-shaft could be made by either of the methods outlined.
On the other hand, a three- or six-cylinder shaft
is best made by the machine forging process, because if
drop forged or cut from the blank it will have to be
heated and the crank throws bent around so that the pins
will lie in three planes one hundred and twenty degrees
apart, while the other types described need no further
attention, as the crank-pins lie in planes one hundred
and eighty degrees apart. This can be better understood
by referring to <a href="#Fig135">Fig. 135</a>, which shows a six-cylinder shaft
in the rough and finished stages. At A the appearance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
of the machine forging before any of the material is removed
is shown, while at B the appearance of the finished
crank-shaft is clearly depicted. The built-up crank-shaft
is seldom used on multiple-cylinder motors, except in
some cases where the crank-shafts revolve on ball bearings
as in some automobile racing engines.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 137.&mdash;Crank-Shaft of Thomas-Morse Eight-Cylinder Vee Engine.</p></div>

<p>Crank-shaft form will vary with a number of cylinders
and it is possible to use a number of different arrangements
of crank-pins and bearings for the same number
of cylinders. The simplest form of crank-shaft is that
used on simple radial cylinder motors as it would consist
of but one crank-pin, two webs, and the crank-shaft. As
the number of cylinders increase in Vee motors as a general
rule more crank-pins are used. The crank-shaft that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
would be used on a two-cylinder opposed motor is shown
at <a href="#Fig136">Fig. 136</a>. This has two throws and the crank-pins are
spaced 180 degrees apart. The bearings are exceptionally
long. Four-cylinder crank-shafts may have two,
three or five main bearings and three or four crank-pins.
In some forms of two-bearing crank-shafts, such as used
when four-cylinders are cast in a block, or unit casting,
two of the pistons are attached to one common crank-pin,
so that in reality the crank-shaft has but three crank-pins.
A typical three bearing, four-cylinder crank-shaft
is shown at <a href="#Fig134">Fig. 134</a>, A. The same type can be used for
an eight-cylinder Vee engine, except for the greater length
of crank-pins to permit of side by side rods as shown at
<a href="#Fig137">Fig. 137</a>. Six cylinder vertical tandem and twelve-cylinder
Vee engine crank-shafts usually have four or seven
main bearings depending upon the disposition of the
crank-pins and arrangement of cylinders. At <a href="#Fig138">Fig. 138</a>,
A,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
the bottom view of a twelve-cylinder engine with bottom
half of crank case removed is given. This illustrates
clearly the arrangement of main bearings when the crank-shaft
is supported on four journals. The crank-shaft
shown at <a href="#Fig138">Fig. 138</a>, B, is a twelve-cylinder seven-bearing
type.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 139.&mdash;Counterbalanced Crank-Shafts Reduce Engine Vibration and
Permit of Higher Rotative Speeds.</p></div>

<p>In some automobile engines, extremely good results
have been secured in obtaining steady running with minimum
vibration by counterbalancing the crank-shafts as
outlined at <a href="#Fig139">Fig. 139</a>. The shaft at A is a type suitable
for a high speed four-cylinder vertical or an eight-cylinder
Vee type. That at B is for a six-cylinder vertical or
a twelve-cylinder V with scissors joint rods. If counterbalancing
crank-shafts helps in an automobile engine, it
should have advantages of some moment in airplane engines,
even though the crank-shaft weight is greater.</p>

<p class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></p>

<h3><a name="SecIX_9" id="SecIX_9"></a>BALL-BEARING CRANK-SHAFTS</h3>

<p>While crank-shafts are usually supported in plain
journals there seems to be a growing tendency of late
to use anti-friction bearings of the ball type for their
support. This is especially noticeable on block motors
where but two main bearings are utilized. When ball
bearings are selected with proper relation to the load
which obtains they will give very satisfactory service.
They permit the crank-shaft to turn with minimum friction,
and if properly selected will never need adjustment.
The front end is supported by a bearing which is clamped
in such a manner that it will take a certain amount of
load in a direction parallel to the axis of the shaft, while
the rear end is so supported that the outer race of the
bearing has a certain amount of axial freedom or &#8220;float.&#8221;
The inner race or cone of each bearing is firmly clamped
against shoulders on the crank-shaft. At the front end
of the crank-shaft timing gear and a suitable check nut
are used, while at the back end the bearing is clamped
by a threaded retention member between the fly-wheel
and a shoulder on the crank-shaft. The fly-wheel is held
in place by a taper and key retention. The ball bearings
are carried in a light housing of bronze or malleable iron,
which in turn are held in the crank-case by bolts. The
Renault engine uses ball bearings at front and rear ends
of the crank-shaft, but has plain bearings around intermediate
crank-shaft journals. The rotary engines of the
Gnome, Le Rhone and Clerget forms would not be practical
if ball bearings were not used as the bearing friction
and consequent depreciation would be very high.</p>

<h3><a name="SecIX_10" id="SecIX_10"></a>ENGINE-BASE CONSTRUCTION</h3>

<p>One of the important parts of the power plant is the
substantial casing or bed member, which is employed to
support the cylinders and crank-shaft and which is attached
directly to the fuselage engine supporting members.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
This will vary widely in form, but as a general
thing it is an approximately cylindrical member which
may be divided either vertically or horizontally in two
or more parts. Airplane engine crank-cases are usually
made of aluminum, a material which has about the same
strength as cast iron, but which only weighs a third as
much. In rare cases cast iron is employed, but is not
favored by most engineers because of its brittle nature,
great weight and low resistance to tensile stresses. Where
exceptional strength is needed alloys of bronze may be
used, and in some cases where engines are produced in
large quantities a portion of the crank-case may be a
sheet steel or aluminum stamping.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="Fig140" id="Fig140"></a>
<img src="images/illo315.jpg" alt="Fig. 140" width="500" height="349" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 140.&mdash;View of Thomas 135 Horse-Power Aeromotor, Model 8, Showing
Conventional Method of Crank-Case Construction.</p></div>

<p>Crank-cases are always large enough to permit the
crank-shaft and parts attached to it to turn inside and
obviously its length is determined by the number of cylinders
and their disposition. The crank-case of the radial
cylinder or double-opposed cylinder engine would be substantially
the same in length. That of a four-cylinder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
will vary in length with the method of casting the cylinder.
When the four-cylinders are cast in one unit and
a two-bearing crank-shaft is used, the crank-case is a very
compact and short member. When a three-bearing crank-shaft
is utilized and the cylinders are cast in pairs, the
engine base is longer than it would be to support a block
casting, but is shorter than one designed to sustain individual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
cylinder castings and a five-bearing crank-shaft.
It is now common construction to cast an oil container
integral with the bottom of the engine base and to draw
the lubricating oil from it by means of a pump, as shown
at <a href="#Fig140">Fig. 140</a>. The arms by which the motor is
supported<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
in the fuselage are substantial-ribbed members cast integrally
with the upper half.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 142.&mdash;Method of Constructing Eight-Cylinder Vee Engine, Possible
if Aluminum Cylinder and Crank-Case Castings are Used.</p></div>

<p>The approved method of crank-case construction favored
by the majority of engineers is shown at the top of
<a href="#Fig141">Fig. 141</a>, bottom side up. The upper half not only forms
a bed for the cylinder but is used to hold the crank-shaft
as well. In the illustration, the three-bearing boxes form
part of the case, while the lower brasses are in the form
of separately cast caps retained by suitable bolts. In
the construction outlined the bottom part of the case
serves merely as an oil container and a protection for
the interior mechanism of the motor. The cylinders are
held down by means of studs screwed into the crank-case
top, as shown at <a href="#Fig141">Fig. 141</a>, lower view. If the aluminum
cylinder motor has any future, the method of construction
outlined at <a href="#Fig142">Fig. 142</a>, which has been used in cast iron
for an automobile motor, might be used for an eight-cylinder
Vee engine for airplane use. The simplicity of
the crank-case needed for a revolving cylinder motor
and its small weight can be well understood by examination
of the illustration at <a href="#Fig143">Fig. 143</a>, which shows the engine
crank-case for the nine-cylinder &#8220;Monosoupape&#8221;
Gnome engine. This consists of two accurately machined
forgings held together by bolts as clearly indicated.</p>

<p><a name="SecX_1" id="SecX_1"></a>The proper installation of the airplane power plant
is more important than is generally supposed, as while
these engines are usually well balanced and run with little
vibration, it is necessary that they be securely anchored
and that various connections to the auxiliary parts be
carefully made in order to prevent breakage from vibration
and that attendant risk of motor stoppage while in
the air. The type of motor to be installed determines
the method of installation to be followed. As a general
rule six-cylinder vertical engine and eight-cylinder Vee
type are mounted in substantially the same way. The
radial, fixed cylinder forms and the radial, rotary cylinder
Gnome and Le Rhone rotary types require an entirely
different method of mounting. Some unconventional
mountings have been devised, notably that shown at <a href="#Fig144">Fig.
144</a>, which is a six-cylinder German engine that is installed
in just the opposite way to that commonly followed.
The inverted cylinder construction is not generally
followed because even with pressure feed, dry
crank-case type lubricating system there is considerable
danger of over-lubrication and of oil collecting and carbonizing
in the combustion chamber and gumming up
the valve action much quicker than would be the case if
the engine was operated in the conventional upright position.
The reason for mounting an engine in this way is
to obtain a lower center of gravity and also to make for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
more perfect streamlining of the front end of the fuselage
in some cases. It is rather doubtful if this slight advantage
will compensate for the disadvantages introduced
by this unusual construction. It is not used to
any extent now but is presented merely to show one of
the possible systems of installing an airplane engine.</p>

Curtiss Tractor Biplane. Note Similarity of Mounting to Automobile
Power Plant.</p></div>

<p>In a number of airplanes of the tractor-biplane type
the power plant installation is not very much different
than that which is found in automobile practice. The
illustration at <a href="#Fig145">Fig. 145</a> is a very clear representation of
the method of mounting the Curtiss eight-cylinder 90
H. P. or model OX-2 engine in the fuselage of the Curtiss
JN-4 tractor biplane which is so generally used in the
United States as a training machine. It will be observed
that the fuel tank is mounted under a cowl directly behind
the motor and that it feeds the carburetor by means of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
flexible fuel pipe. As the tank is mounted higher than the
carburetor, it will feed that member by gravity. The
radiator is mounted at the front end of the fuselage and
connected to the water piping on the motor by the usual
rubber hose connections. An oil pan is placed under the
engine and the top is covered with a hood just as in
motor car practice. The panels of aluminum are attached
to the sides of the fuselage and are supplied with doors
which open and provide access to the carburetor, oil-gauge
and other parts of the motor requiring inspection.
The complete installation with the power plant enclosed
is given at <a href="#Fig146">Fig. 146</a>, and in this it will be observed that
the exhaust pipes are connected to discharge members
that lead the gases above the top plane. In the engine
shown at <a href="#Fig145">Fig. 145</a> the exhaust flows directly into the air
at the sides of the machine through short pipes bolted to
the exhaust gas outlet ports. The installation of the<span

cooling will be obtained because of the rapid air
flow due to the propeller slip stream.</p>

<h3><a name="SecX_2" id="SecX_2"></a>INSTALLATION OF CURTISS OX-2 ENGINE</h3>

<p>The following instructions are given in the Curtiss
Instruction Book for installing the OX-2 engine and preparing
it for flights, and taken in connection with the very
clear illustration presented no difficulty should be experienced
in understanding the proper installation, and mounting
of this power plant. The bearers or beds should be
2 inches wide by 3 inches deep, preferably of laminated
hard wood, and placed 11<sup>5</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> inches apart. They must be
well braced. The six arms of the base of the motor are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
drilled for <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>-inch bolts, and none but this size should
he used.</p>

<p>1. <i>Anchoring the Motor.</i> Put the bolts in from the
bottom, with a large washer under the head of each so
the head cannot cut into the wood. On every bolt use a
castellated nut and a cotter pin, or an ordinary nut and
a lock washer, so the bolt will not work loose. Always
set motor in place and fasten before attaching any auxiliary
apparatus, such as carburetor, etc.</p>

<p>2. <i>Inspecting the Ignition-Switch Wires.</i> The wires
leading from the ignition switch must be properly connected&mdash;one
end to the motor body for ground, and the
other end to the post on the breaker box of the magneto.</p>

<p>3. <i>Filling the Radiator.</i> Be sure that the water from
the radiator fills the cylinder jackets. Pockets of air
may remain in the cylinder jackets even though the
radiator may appear full. Turn the motor over a few
times by hand after filling the radiator, and then add
more water if the radiator will take it. The air pockets,
if allowed to remain, may cause overheating and develop
serious trouble when the motor is running.</p>

<p>4. <i>Filling the Oil Reservoir.</i> Oil is admitted into the
crank-case through the breather tube at the rear. It is
well to strain all oil put into the crank-case. In filling the
oil reservoir be sure to turn the handle on the oil sight-gauge
till it is at right angles with the gauge. The oil
sight-gauge is on the side of the lower half of the crank-case.
Put in about 3 gallons of the best obtainable oil,
Mobile B recommended. It is important to remember
that the very best oil is none too good.</p>

<p>5. <i>Oiling Exposed Moving Parts.</i> Oil all rocker-arm
bearings before each flight. A little oil should be applied
where the push rods pass through the stirrup straps.</p>

<p>6. <i>Filling the Gasoline Tanks.</i> Be certain that all
connections in the gasoline system are tight.</p>

<p>7. <i>Turning on the Gasoline.</i> Open the cock leading
from the gasoline tank to the carburetor.</p>

<p>8. <i>Charging the Cylinders.</i> With the ignition switch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
OFF, prime the motor by squirting a little gasoline in
each exhaust port and then turn the propeller backward
two revolutions. Never open the exhaust valve by operating
the rocker-arm by hand, as the push-rod is liable to
come out of its socket in the cam follower and bend the
rocker-arm when the motor turns over.</p>

<p>9. <i>Starting the Motor by Hand.</i> Always retard the
spark part way, to prevent back-firing, by pulling forward
the wire attached to the breaker box. Failure to so
retard the spark in starting may result in serious injury
to the operator. Turn on the ignition switch with throttle
partly open; give a quick, strong pull down and outward
on the starting crank or propeller. As soon as the motor
is started advance the spark by releasing the retard wire.</p>

<p>10. <i>Oil Circulation.</i> Let the motor run at low speed
for a few minutes in order to establish oil circulation in
all bearings. With all parts functioning properly, the
throttle may be opened gradually for warming up before
flight.</p>

<h3><a name="SecX_3" id="SecX_3"></a>STANDARD S.A.E. ENGINE BED DIMENSIONS</h3>

<p>The Society of Automotive Engineers have made efforts
to standardize dimensions of bed timbers for supporting
power plant in an aeroplane. Owing to the great
difference in length no standardization is thought possible
in this regard. The dimensions recommended are as
follows:</p>

<table class="fsize80" summary="Table p 330">

<tr>
<td class="left padr5">Distance between timbers</td>
<td class="right padr0">12</td>

<td class="right padr0">14</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td class="left padl1 padr5">in.</td>
<td class="right padl1">16</td>
<td class="left padl1">in.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="left padr5">Width of bed timbers</td>
<td class="right padr0">1</td>
<td class="left padl0"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></td>
<td class="left padl1 padr5">in.</td>
<td class="right padr0">1</td>
<td class="left padl0 padr1"><sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub></td>
<td class="left padl1 padr5">in.</td>
<td class="right padl1">2</td>
<td class="left padl1">in.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="left padr5">Distance between centers of bolts</td>
<td class="right padr0">13</td>
<td class="left padl0"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></td>
<td class="left padl1 padr5">in.</td>
<td class="right padr0">15</td>
<td class="left padl0 padr1"><sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub></td>
<td class="left padl1 padr5">in.</td>
<td class="right padl1">18</td>
<td class="left padl1">in.</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>It will be evident that if any standard of this nature
were adopted by engine builders that the designers of
fuselage could easily arrange their bed timbers to conform
to these dimensions, whereas it would be difficult to
have them adhere to any standard longitudinal dimensions
which are much more easily varied in fuselages
than the transverse dimensions are. It, however, should<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331"></a></span>
be possible to standardize the longitudinal positions of
the holding down bolts as the engine designer would still
be able to allow himself considerable space fore-and-aft
of the bolts.</p>

<h3><a name="SecX_5" id="SecX_5"></a>FUEL SYSTEM INSTALLATION</h3>

<p>Gasoline giving the best results with this equipment
is as follows: Gravity 58-62 deg. Baume A. Initial boiling
point&mdash;Richmond method&mdash;<span class="nowrap">102&deg;</span> Fahr. Sulphur .014.
Calorimetric bomb test 20610 B. T. U. per pound. If the
gasoline tank is placed in the fuselage below the level of
the carburetor, a hand pump must be used to maintain
air pressure in gas tank to force the gasoline to the carburetor.
After starting the engine the small auxiliary air
pump upon the engine will maintain sufficient pressure.
A-7a and A-5a engines are furnished with a new type
auxiliary air pump. This should be frequently oiled and
care taken so no grit or sand will enter which might lodge
between the valve and its seat, which would make it fail
to operate properly. An air relief valve is furnished with
each engine. It should be screwed into the gas tank and
properly regulated to maintain the pressure required.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
This is done by screwing the ratchet on top either up or
down. If two tanks are used in a plane one should be
installed in each tank. All air pump lines should be carefully<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339"
id="Page_339">[339]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338"></a></span>
gone over quite frequently to ascertain if they are
tight. Check valves have to be placed in these lines. In
some cases the gasoline tank is placed above the engine,
allowing it to drain by gravity to the carburetor. When
using this system there should be a drop of not less than
two feet from the lowest portion of the gasoline tank to
the upper part of the carburetor float chamber. Even
this height might not be sufficient to maintain the proper
volume of gasoline to the carburetor at high speeds. Air
pressure is advised upon all tanks to insure the proper
supply of gasoline. When using gravity feed without
air pressure be sure to vent the tank to allow circulation
of air. If gravity tank is used and the engine runs satisfactorily
at low speeds but cuts out at high speeds the
trouble is undoubtedly due to insufficient height of the
tank above the carburetor. The tank should be raised or
air pressure system used.</p>

<h3><a name="SecX_6" id="SecX_6"></a>IGNITION SWITCHES</h3>

<p>Two &#8220;DIXIE&#8221; switches are furnished with each engine.
Both of these should be installed in the pilot&#8217;s
seat, one controlling the R. H., and the other the L. H.
magneto. By shorting either one or the other it can be
quickly determined if both magnetos, with their respective
spark-plugs, are working correctly. Care should be
taken not to use spark-plugs having <i>special extensions or
long protruding points</i>. Plugs giving best results are extremely
small with short points.</p>

<h3><a name="SecX_7" id="SecX_7"></a>WATER SYSTEMS</h3>

<p>A temperature gauge should be installed in the water
pipe, coming directly from the cylinder nearest the propeller
(note illustration above). This instrument installed
in the radiator cap has not always given satisfactory
results. This is especially noticeable when the
water in the radiator becomes low, not allowing it to
touch the bulb on the moto-meter. For ordinary running,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
it should not indicate over 150 degrees Fahr. In climbing
tests, however, a temperature of 160 degrees Fahr.
can be maintained without any ill effects upon the engine.
In case the engine becomes overheated, the indicator
will register above 180 degrees Fahr., in which case
it should be stopped immediately. Overheating is most
generally caused by retarded spark, excessive carbon in
the cylinders, insufficient lubrication, improperly timed
valves, lack of water, clogging of water system in any
way which would obstruct the free circulation of the
water.</p>

<p>Overheating will cause the engine to knock, with possible
damaging results. Suction pipes should be made
out of thin tubing, and run within a quarter or an eighth
of an inch of each other, so that when a hose is placed
over the two, it will not be possible to suck together.
This is often the case when a long rubber hose is used,
which causes overheating. Radiators should be flushed
out and cleaned thoroughly quite often. A dirty radiator
may cause overheating.</p>

<p>When filling the radiator it is very important to remove
the plug on top of the water pump until water
appears. This is to avoid air pockets being formed in the
circulating system, which might not only heat up the
engine, but cause considerable damage. All water pump
hoses and connections should be tightly taped and shellacked
after the engine is properly installed in the plane.
The greatest care should be taken when making engine
installation <i>not</i> to use smaller inside diameter hose connection
than water pump suction end casting. One inch
and a quarter inside diameter should be used on A-7 and
A-5 motors, while nothing less than one inch and a half
inside diameter hose or tubing on all A-7a and A-5a engines.
It is further important to have light spun tubing,
void of any sharp turns, leads from pump to radiator and
cylinder water outlet to radiator. In other words, the
water circulation through the engine must be as little
restricted as possible. Be sure no light hose is used, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
will often suck together when engine is started. To thoroughly
drain the water from the entire system, open the
drain cock at the lowest side of the water pump.</p>

<h3><a name="SecX_8" id="SecX_8"></a>PREPARATIONS TO START ENGINE</h3>

<p>Always replenish gasoline tanks through a strainer
which is clean. This strainer must catch all water and
other impurities in the gasoline. Pour at least three
gallons of fresh oil into the lower crank-case. Oil all
rocker arms through oilers upon rocker arm housing caps.
Be sure radiators are filled within one inch of the top.</p>

<p>After all the parts are oiled, and the tanks filled, the
following must be looked after before starting: See if
crank-shaft flange is tight on shaft. See if propeller bolts
are tight and evenly drawn up. See if propeller bolts are
wired. See if propeller is trued up to within <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>&#8242;&#8242;.</span></p>

<p>Every four days the magnetos should be oiled if the
engine is in daily use.</p>

<p>Every month all cylinder hold-down nuts should be
gone over to ascertain if they are tight. (Be sure to recotter
nuts.)</p>

<p>See if magnetos are bolted on tight and wired.</p>

<p>See if magneto cables are in good condition.</p>

<p>See if rocker arm tappets have a <span class="nowrap">.020&#8242;&#8242;</span> clearance from
valve stem when valve is seated.</p>

<p>See if tappet clamp screws are tight and cottered.</p>

<p>See if all gasoline, oil, water pipes and connections are
in perfect condition.</p>

<p>Air on gas line should be tested for leaks.</p>

<p>Pump at least three pounds air pressure into gasoline
tank.</p>

<p>After making sure that above rules have been observed,
test compression of cylinders by turning propeller.</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;DO NOT FORGET TO SHORT BOTH MAGNETOS&#8221;</p>

<p>Be sure all compression release and priming cocks do
not leak compression. If they do, replace same with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
new one immediately, as this might cause premature
firing.</p>

<p>Open priming cocks and squirt some gasoline into each.</p>

<p>Close cocks.</p>

<p>Open compression release cocks.</p>

<p>Open throttle slightly.</p>

<p>If using Berling magnetos they should be three-quarters
advanced.</p>

<p>If all the foregoing directions have been carefully
followed, the engine is ready for starting.</p>

<p>In cranking engine either by starting crank, or propeller,
it is essential to throw it over compression quickly.</p>

<p>Immediately upon starting, close compression release
cocks.</p>

<p>When engine is running, advance magnetos.</p>

<p>After it has warmed up, short one magneto and then
the other, to be sure both magnetos and spark-plugs are
firing properly. If there is a miss, the fouled plug must
be located and cleaned. There is a possibility that the
jets in the carburetor are stopped up. If this is the case,
do not attempt to clean same with any sharp instrument.
If this is done, it might change the opening in the jets,
thus spoiling the adjustment. Jets and nozzles should
be blown out with air or steam.</p>

<p>An open intake or exhaust valve, which might have
become sluggish or stuck from carbon, might cause
trouble. Be sure to remedy this at once by using a little
coal-oil or kerosene on same, working the valve by hand
until it becomes free. We recommend using graphite on
valve stems mixed with oil to guard against sticking or
undue wear.</p>

<h3><a name="SecX_10" id="SecX_10"></a>PRACTICAL HINTS TO LOCATE ENGINE TROUBLES</h3>

<p>One who is not thoroughly familiar with engine construction
will seldom locate troubles by haphazard experimenting
and it is only by a systematic search that the
cause can be discovered and the defects eliminated. In
this chapter the writer proposes to outline some of the
most common power-plant troubles and to give sufficient
advice to enable those who are not thoroughly informed
to locate them by a logical process of elimination. The
internal-combustion motor, which is the power plant of
all gasoline automobiles as well as airplanes, is composed
of a number of distinct groups, which in turn include distinct
components. These various appliances are so closely
related to each other that defective action of any one may
interrupt the operation of the entire power plant. Some
of the auxiliary groups are more necessary than others
and the power plant will continue to operate for a time
even after the failure of some important parts of some
of the auxiliary groups. The gasoline engine in itself is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
a complete mechanism, but it is evident that it cannot
deliver any power without some means of supplying gas
to the cylinders and igniting the compressed gas charge
after it has been compressed in the cylinders. From this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
it is patent that the ignition and carburetion systems are
just as essential parts of the power plant as the piston,
connecting rod, or cylinder of the motor. The failure of
either the carburetor or igniting means to function properly
will be immediately apparent by faulty action of the
power plant.</p>

<p>To insure that the motor will continue to operate it
is necessary to keep it from overheating by some form of
cooling system and to supply oil to the moving parts to
reduce friction. The cooling and lubrication groups are
not so important as carburetion and ignition, as the engine
would run for a limited period of time even should
the cooling system fail or the oil supply cease. It would
only be a few moments, however, before the engine would
overheat if the cooling system was at fault, and the parts
seize if the lubricating system should fail. Any derangement
in the carburetor or ignition mechanism would manifest
itself at once because the engine operation would be
affected, but a defect in the cooling or oiling system would
not be noticed so readily.</p>

<p>The careful aviator will always inspect the motor
mechanism before starting on a trip of any consequence,
and if inspection is carefully carried out and loose parts
tightened it is seldom that irregular operation will be
found due to actual breakage of any of the components
of the mechanism. Deterioration due to natural causes
matures slowly, and sufficient warning is always given
when parts begin to wear so satisfactory repairs may be
promptly made before serious derangement or failure is
manifested.</p>

<h3><a name="SecX_11" id="SecX_11"></a>A TYPICAL ENGINE STOPPAGE ANALYZED</h3>

<p>Before describing the points that may fail in the various
auxiliary systems it will be well to assume a typical
case of engine failure and show the process of locating
the trouble in a systematic manner by indicating the
various steps which are in logical order and which could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
reasonably be followed. In any case of engine failure the
ignition system, motor compression, and carburetor should
be tested first. If the ignition system is functioning properly
one should determine the amount of compression in
all cylinders and if this is satisfactory the carbureting
group should be tested. If the ignition system is working
properly and there is a decided resistance in the cylinders
when the propeller is turned, proving that there is good
compression, one may suspect the carburetor.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="Fig160" id="Fig160"></a>
<p class="leftlink"><a href="images/large343.png">Large<br />image<br />(78 kB).</a></p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 160.&mdash;Side Elevation of Thomas 135 Horse-Power Airplane Engine,
Giving Important Dimensions.</p></div>

<p>If the carburetor appears to be in good condition, the
trouble may be caused by the ignition being out of time,
which condition is possible when the magneto timing gear
or coupling is attached to the armature shaft by a taper
and nut retention instead of the more positive key or
taper-pin fastening. It is possible that the inlet manifold
may be broken or perforated, that the exhaust valve is
stuck on its seat because of a broken or bent stem, broken
or loose cam, or failure of the cam-shaft drive because
the teeth are stripped from the engine shaft or cam-shaft<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
gears; or because the key or other fastening on either
gear has failed, allowing that member to turn independently
of the shaft to which it normally is attached. The
gasoline feed pipe may be clogged or broken, the fuel
supply may be depleted, or the shut-off cock in the gasoline
line may have jarred closed. The gasoline filter may
be filled with dirt or water which prevents passage of the
fuel.</p>

<p>The defects outlined above, except the failure of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
gasoline supply, are very rare, and if the container is
found to contain fuel and the pipe line to be clear to the
carburetor, it is safe to assume the vaporizing device is
at fault. If fuel continually runs out of the mixing chamber
the carburetor is said to be flooded. This condition
results from failure of the shut-off needle to seat properly
or from a punctured hollow metal float or a gasoline-soaked
cork float. It is possible that not enough gasoline
is present in the float chamber. If the passage controlled
by the float-needle valve is clogged or if the float was
badly out of adjustment, this contingency would be probable.
When the carburetor is examined, if the gasoline
level appears to be at the proper height, one may suspect
that a particle of lint, or dust, or fine scale, or rust from
the gasoline tank has clogged the bore of the jet in the
mixing chamber.</p>

<p>If the ignition system and carburetor appear to be in
good working order, and the hand crank shows that there
is no compression in one or more of the cylinders, it
means some defect in the valve system. If the engine is
a multiple-cylinder type and one finds poor compression
in all of the cylinders it may be due to the rare defect
of improper valve timing. This may be caused by a gear
having altered its position on the cam-shaft or crank-shaft,
because of a sheared key or pin having permitted
the gear to turn about half of a revolution and then
having caught and held the gear in place by a broken or
jagged end so that cam-shaft would turn, but the valves
open at the wrong time. If but one of the cylinders is
at fault and the rest appear to have good compression
the trouble may be due to a defective condition either inside
or outside of that cylinder. The external parts may
be inspected easily, so the following should be looked for:
a broken valve, a warped valve-head, broken valve-springs,
sticking or bent valve-stems, dirt under valve-seat, leak
at valve-chamber cap or spark-plug gasket. Defective
priming cock, cracked cylinder head (rarely occurs), leak
through cracked spark-plug insulation, valve-plunger<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
stuck in the guide, lack of clearance between valve-stem
end and top of plunger caused by loose adjusting screw
which has worked up and kept the valve from seating.
The faulty compression may be due to defects inside the
motor. The piston-head may be cracked (rarely occurs),
piston rings may be broken, the slots in the piston rings
may be in line, the rings may have lost their elasticity
or have become gummed in the grooves of the piston, or
the piston and cylinder walls may be badly scored by a
loose wrist pin or by defective lubrication. If the motor
is a type with a separate head it is possible the gasket
or packing between the cylinder and combustion chamber
may leak, either admitting water to the cylinder or allowing
compression to escape.</p>

<h3>CONDITIONS THAT CAUSE FAILURE OF IGNITION SYSTEM</h3>

<p>If the first test of the motor had showed that the compression
was as it should be and that there were no serious
mechanical defects and there was plenty of gasoline
at the carburetor, this would have demonstrated that the
ignition system was not functioning properly. If a battery
is employed to supply current the first step is to take
the spark-plugs out of the cylinders and test the system
by turning over the engine by hand. If there is no spark
in any of the plugs, this may be considered a positive
indication that there is a broken main current lead from
the battery, a defective ground connection, a loose battery
terminal, or a broken connector. If none of these
conditions are present, it is safe to say that the battery
is no longer capable of delivering current. While magneto
ignition is generally used on airplane engines, there
is apt to be some development of battery ignition, especially
on engines equipped with electric self-starters which
are now being experimented with. The spark-plugs may
be short circuited by cracked insulation or carbon and
oil deposits around the electrode. The secondary wires
may be broken or have defective insulation which permits<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
the current to ground to some metal part of the fuselage
or motor. The electrodes of the spark-plug may be too
far apart to permit a spark to overcome the resistance
of the compressed gas, even if a spark jumps the air
space, when the plug is laid on the cylinder.</p>

<p>If magnetos are fitted as is usually the case at present
and a spark is obtained between the points of the plug
and that device or the wire leading to it from the magneto
is in proper condition, the trouble is probably caused by
the magneto being out of time. This may result if the
driving gear is loose on the armature-shaft or crank-shaft,
and is a rare occurrence. If no spark is produced
at the plugs the secondary wire may be broken, the ground
wire may make contact with some metallic portion of the
chassis before it reaches the switch, the carbon collecting
brushes may be broken or not making contact, the contact
points of the make-and-break device may be out of adjustment,
the wiring may be attached to wrong terminals, the
distributor filled with metallic particles, carbon, dust or
oil accumulations, the distributor contacts may not be
making proper connection because of wear and there may
be a more serious derangement, such as a burned out
secondary winding or a punctured condenser.</p>

<p>If the motor runs intermittently, <i>i.e.</i>, starts and runs
only a few revolutions, aside from the conditions previously
outlined, defective operation may be due to seizing
between parts because of insufficient oil or deficient
cooling, too much oil in the crank-case which fouls the
cylinder after the crank-shaft has revolved a few turns,
and derangements in the ignition or carburetion systems
that may be easily remedied. There are a number of
defective conditions which may exist in the ignition group,
that will result in &#8220;skipping&#8221; or irregular operation and
the following points should be considered first: weak
source of current due to worn out dry cells or discharged
storage batteries; weak magnets in magneto, or defective
contacts at magneto; dirt in magneto distributor or poor
contact at collecting brushes. Dirty or cracked insulator<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
at spark-plug will cause short circuit and can only be
detected by careful examination. The following points
should also be checked over when the plug is inspected:
Excessive space between electrodes, points too close together,
loose central electrodes, or loose point on plug
body, soot or oil particles between electrodes, or on the
surface of the insulator, cracked insulator, oil or water
on outside of insulator. Short circuits in the condenser
or internal wiring of induction coils or magnetos, which
are fortunately not common, can seldom be remedied except
at the factory where these devices were made. If an
engine stops suddenly and the defect is in the ignition
system the trouble is usually never more serious than a
broken or loose wire. This may be easily located by inspecting
the wiring at the terminals. Irregular operation
or misfiring is harder to locate because the trouble can
only be found after the many possible defective conditions
have been checked over, one by one.</p>

<h3>COMMON DEFECTS IN FUEL SYSTEMS</h3>

<p>Defective carburetion often causes misfiring or irregular
operation. The common derangement of the components
of the fuel system that are common enough to
warrant suspicion and the best methods for their location
follows: First, disconnect the feed pipe from the carburetor
and see if the gasoline flows freely from the tank.
If the stream coming out of the pipe is not the full size
of the orifice it is an indication that the pipe is clogged
with dirt or that there is an accumulation of rust, scale,
or lint in the strainer screens of the filter. It is also
possible that the fuel shut-off valve may be wholly or
partly closed. If the gasoline flows by gravity the liquid
may be air bound in the tank, while if a pressure-feed
system is utilized the tank may leak so that it does not
retain pressure; the check valve retaining the pressure
may be defective or the pipe conveying the air or gas
under pressure to the tank may be clogged.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>If the gasoline flows from the pipe in a steady stream
the carburetor demands examination. There may be dirt
or water in the float chamber, which will constrict the
passage between the float chamber and the spray nozzle,
or a particle of foreign matter may have entered the
nozzle and stopped up the fine holes therein. The float
may bind on its guide, the needle valve regulating the
gasoline-inlet opening in bowl may stick to its seat. Any
of the conditions mentioned would cut down the gasoline
supply and the engine would not receive sufficient quantities
of gas. The air-valve spring may be weak or the
air valve broken. The gasoline-adjusting needle may be
loose and jar out of adjustment, or the air-valve spring-adjusting
nuts may be such a poor fit on the stem that
adjustments will not be retained. These instructions apply
only to carburetors having air valves and mixture
regulating means which are used only in rare instances
in airplane work. Air may leak in through the manifold,
due to a porous casting, or leaky joints in a built up form
and dilute the mixture. The air-intake dust screen may
be so clogged with dirt and lint that not enough air will
pass through the mesh. Water or sediment in the gasoline
will cause misfiring because the fuel feed varies when
the water or dirt constricts the standpipe bore.</p>

<p>It is possible that the carburetor may be out of adjustment.
If clouds of black smoke are emitted at the
exhaust pipe it is positive indication that too much gasoline
is being supplied the mixture and the supply should
be cut down by screwing in the needle valve on types
where this method of regulation is provided, and by making
sure that the fuel level is at the proper height, or that
the proper nozzle is used in those forms where the spray
nozzle has no means of adjustment. If the mixture contains
too much air there will be a pronounced popping
back in the carburetor. This may be overcome by screwing
in the air-valve adjustment so the spring tension is
increased or by slightly opening up the gasoline-supply
regulation needle. When a carburetor is properly adjusted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
and the mixture delivered the cylinder burns properly,
the exhaust gas will be clean and free from the
objectionable odor present when gasoline is burned in
excess.</p>

<p>The character of combustion may be judged by the
color of the flame which issues from it when the engine
is running with an open throttle after nightfall. If the
flame is red, it indicates too much gasoline. If yellowish,
it shows an excess of air, while a properly proportioned
mixture will be evidenced by a pronounced blue flame,
such as given by a gas-stove burner.</p>

<p>The Duplex Model O. D. Zenith carburetor used upon
most of the six- and eight-cylinder airplane engines consists
of a single float chamber, and a single air intake,
joined to two separate and distinct spray nozzles, venturi
and idling adjustments. It is to be noted that as the
carburetor barrels are arranged side by side, both valves
are mounted on the same shaft, and work in unison
through a single operating lever. It is not necessary to
alter their position. In order to make the engine idle
well, it is essential that the ignition, especially the spark-plugs,
should be in good condition. The gaskets between
carburetor and manifold, and between manifold and cylinders
should be absolutely air-tight. The adjustment for
low speed on the carburetor is made by turning in or out
the two knurled screws, placed one on each side of the
float chamber. After starting the engine and allowing it
to become thoroughly warmed, one side of the carburetor
should be adjusted so that the three cylinders it affects
fire properly at low speed. The other side should be
adjusted in the same manner until all six cylinders fire
perfectly at low speed. As the adjustment is changed
on the knurled screw a difference in the idling of the engine
should be noticed. If the engine begins to run evenly
or speeds up it shows that the mixture becomes right in
its proportion.</p>

<p>Be sure the butterfly throttle is closed as far as possible
by screwing out the stop screw which regulates the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
closed position for idling. Care should be taken to have
the butterfly held firmly against this stop screw at all
times while idling engine. If three cylinders seem to run
irregularly after changing the position of the butterfly,
still another adjustment may have to be made with the
knurled screw. Unscrewing this makes the mixture
leaner. Screwing in closes off some of the air supply to
the idling jet, making it richer. After one side has been
made to idle satisfactorily repeat the same procedure with
the opposite three cylinders. In other words, each side
should be idled independently to about the same speed.</p>

<p>Remember that the main jet and compensating jet
have no appreciable effect on the idling of the engine.
The idling mixture is drawn directly through the opening
determined by the knurled screw and enters the carburetor
barrel through the small hole at the edge of each
butterfly. This is called the priming hole and is only
effective during idling. Beyond that point the suction is
transferred to the main jet and compensator, which controls
the power of the engine beyond the idling position
of the throttle.</p>

<h3>DEFECTS IN OILING SYSTEMS</h3>

<p>While troubles existing in the ignition or carburetion
groups are usually denoted by imperfect operation of
the motor, such as lost power, and misfiring, derangements
of the lubrication or cooling systems are usually
evident by overheating, diminution in engine capacity, or
noisy operation. Overheating may be caused by poor
carburetion as much as by deficient cooling or insufficient
oiling. When the oiling group is not functioning as it
should the friction between the motor parts produces heat.
If the cooling system is in proper condition, as will be
evidenced by the condition of the water in the radiator,
and the carburetion group appears to be in good condition,
the overheating is probably caused by some defect
in the oiling system.</p>

<p>The conditions that most commonly result in poor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
lubrication are: Insufficient oil in the engine crank-case
or sump, broken or clogged oil pipes, screen at filter filled
with lint or dirt, broken oil pump, or defective oil-pump
drive. The supply of oil may be reduced by a defective
inlet or discharge-check valve at the mechanical oiler or
worn pumps. A clogged oil passage or pipe leading to
an important bearing point will cause trouble because
the oil cannot get between the working surfaces. It is
well to remember that much of the trouble caused by
defective oiling may be prevented by using only the best
grades of lubricant, and even if all parts of the oil system
are working properly, oils of poor quality will cause
friction and overheating.</p>

<h3>DEFECTS IN COOLING SYSTEMS OUTLINED</h3>

<p>Cooling systems are very simple and are not liable to
give trouble as a rule if the radiator is kept full of clean
water and the circulation is not impeded. When overheating
is due to defective cooling the most common
troubles are those that impede water circulation. If the
radiator is clogged or the piping of water jackets filled
with rust or sediment the speed of water circulation will
be slow, which will also be the case if the water pump or
its driving means fail. Any scale or sediment in the water
jackets or in the piping or radiator passages will reduce
the heat conductivity of the metal exposed to the air, and
the water will not be cooled as quickly as though the scale
was not present.</p>

<p>The rubber hose often used in making the flexible
connections demanded between the radiator and water
manifolds of the engine may deteriorate inside and particles
of rubber hang down that will reduce the area of
the passage. The grease from the grease cups mounted
on the pump-shaft bearing to lubricate that member often
finds its way into the water system and rots the inner
walls of the rubber hose, this resulting in strips of the
partly decomposed rubber lining hanging down and restricting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
the passage. The cooling system is prone to
overheat after antifreezing solutions of which calcium
chloride forms a part have been used. This is due to
the formation of crystals of salt in the radiator passages
or water jackets, and these crystals can only be dissolved
by suitable chemical means, or removed by scraping when
the construction permits.</p>

<p>Overheating is often caused by some condition in the
fuel system that produces too rich or too lean mixture.
Excess gasoline may be supplied if any of the following
conditions are present: Bore of spray nozzle or standpipe
too large, auxiliary air-valve spring too tight, gasoline
level too high, loose regulating valve, fuel-soaked
cork float, punctured sheet-metal float, dirt under float
control shut-off valve or insufficient air supply because
of a clogged air screen. If pressure feed is utilized there
may be too much pressure in the tank, or the float controlled
mechanism operating the shut-off in the float bowl
of the carburetor may not act quickly enough.</p>

<h3>SOME CAUSES OF NOISY OPERATION</h3>

<p>There are a number of power-plant derangements
which give positive indication because of noisy operation.
Any knocking or rattling sounds are usually produced by
wear in connecting rods or main bearings of the engine,
though sometimes a sharp metallic knock, which is very
much the same as that produced by a loose bearing, is due
to carbon deposits in the cylinder heads, or premature
ignition due to advanced spark-time lever. Squeaking
sounds invariably indicate dry bearings, and whenever
such a sound is heard it should be immediately located
and oil applied to the parts thus denoting their dry condition.
Whistling or blowing sounds are produced by
leaks, either in the engine itself or in the gas manifolds.
A sharp whistle denotes the escape of gas under pressure
and is usually caused by a defective packing or gasket
that seals a portion of the combustion chamber or that is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
used for a joint as the exhaust manifold. A blowing
sound indicates a leaky packing in crank-case. Grinding
noises in the motor are usually caused by the timing gears
and will obtain if these gears are dry or if they have become
worn. Whenever a loud knocking sound is heard
careful inspection should be made to locate the cause of
the trouble. Much harm may be done in a few minutes
if the engine is run with loose connecting rod or bearings
that would be prevented by taking up the wear or looseness
between the parts by some means of adjustment.</p>

<h3>BRIEF SUMMARY OF HINTS FOR STARTING ENGINE</h3>

<p>First make sure that all cylinders have compression.
To ascertain this, open pet cocks of all cylinders except
the one to be tested, crank over motor and see that a
strong opposition to cranking is met with once in two
revolutions. If motor has no pet cocks, crank and notice
that oppositions are met at equal distances, two to every
revolution of the starting crank in a four-cylinder motor.
If compression is lacking, examine the parts of the cylinder
or cylinders at fault in the following order, trying to
start the motor whenever any one fault is found and
remedied. See that the valve push rods or rocker arms
do not touch valve stems for more than approximately
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> revolution in every 2 revolutions, and that there is not
more than .010 to .020 inch clearance between them depending
on the make of the motor. Make sure that the
exhaust valve seats. To determine this examine the
spring and see that it is connected to the valve stem
properly. Take out valve and see that there is no obstruction,
such as carbon, on its seat. See that valve
works freely in its guide. Examine inlet valve in same
manner. Listen for hissing sound while cranking motor
for leaks at other places.</p>

<p>Make sure that a spark occurs in each cylinder as
follows: If magneto or magneto and battery with non-vibrating
coil is used: Disconnect wire from spark-plug,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
hold end about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> inch from cylinder or terminal of spark-plug.
Have motor cranked briskly and see if spark occurs.
Examine adjustment of interrupter points. See that
wires are placed correctly and not short circuited. Take
out spark-plug and lay it on the cylinder, being careful
that base of plug only touches the cylinder and that ignition
wire is connected. Have motor cranked briskly and
see if spark occurs. Check timing of magneto and see
that all brushes are making contact.</p>

<p>See if there is gasoline in the carburetor. See that
there is gasoline in the tank. Examine valve at tank.
Prime carburetor and see that spray nozzle passage is
clear. Be sure throttle is open. Prime cylinders by putting
about a teaspoonful of gasoline in through pet cock
or spark-plug opening. Adjust carburetor if necessary.</p>

<h3><a name="SecX_12" id="SecX_12"></a>LOCATION OF ENGINE TROUBLES MADE EASY</h3>

<p>The following tabulation has been prepared and originated
by the writer to outline in a simple manner the
various troubles and derangements that interfere with
efficient internal-combustion engine action. The parts
and their functions are practically the same in all gas or
gasoline engines of the four-cycle type, and the general
instructions given apply just as well to all hydro-carbon
engines, even if the parts differ in form materially. The
essential components are clearly indicated in the many
part sectional drawings in this book so they may be
easily recognized. The various defects that may materialize
are tabulated in a manner that makes for ready
reference, and the various defective conditions are found
opposite the part affected, and under a heading that denotes
the main trouble to which the others are contributing
causes. The various symptoms denoting the
individual troubles outlined are given to facilitate their
recognition in a positive manner.</p>

<p>Brief note is also made of the remedies for the restoration
of the defective part or condition. It is apparent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
that a table of this character is intended merely as a
guide, and it is a compilation of practically all the known
troubles that may materialize in gas-engine operation.
While most of the defects outlined are common enough
to warrant suspicion, they will never exist in an engine
all at the same time, and it will be necessary to make a
systematic search for such of those as exist.</p>

<p>To use the list advantageously, it is necessary to know
one main trouble easily recognized. For example, if the
power plant is noisy, look for the possible troubles under
the head of Noisy Operation; if it lacks capacity, the
derangement will undoubtedly be found under the head of
Lost Power. It is assumed in all cases that the trouble
exists in the power plant or its components, and not in
the auxiliary members of the ignition, carburetion, lubrication,
or cooling systems. The novice and student will
readily recognize the parts of the average aviation engine
by referring to the very complete and clearly lettered
illustrations of mechanism given in many parts of this
treatise.</p>

<h3>DEFECTS IN ELECTRICAL SYSTEM COMPONENTS</h3>

<p>To further simplify the location of electrical system
faults it is thought desirable to outline the defects that
can be present in the various parts of the individual devices
comprising the ignition system. If an airplane
engine is provided with magneto ignition solely, as most
engines are at the present time, no attention need be
paid to such items as storage or dry batteries, timer or
induction coil. There seems to be some development in
the direction of battery ignition so it has been considered
desirable to include components of these systems as well
as the almost universally used magneto group. Spark-plugs,
wiring and switches are needed with either system.</p>

<h3><a name="SecXI_1" id="SecXI_1"></a>TOOLS FOR ADJUSTING AND ERECTING</h3>

<p>A very complete outfit of small tools, some of which
are furnished as part of the tool equipment of various
engines are shown in group at <a href="#Fig163">Fig. 163</a>. This group includes
all of the tools necessary to complete a very practical
kit and it is not unusual for the mechanic who is
continually dismantling and erecting engines to possess
even a larger assortment than indicated. The small bench
vise provided is a useful auxiliary that can be clamped
to any convenient bench or table or even fuselage longeron
in an emergency and should have jaws at least three
inches wide and capable of opening four or five inches.
It is especially useful in that it will save trips to the
bench vises, as it has adequate capacity to handle practically
any of the small parts that need to be worked on
when making repairs. A blow torch, tinner&#8217;s snips and
soldering copper are very useful in sheet metal work and
in making any repairs requiring the use of solder. The
torch can be used in any operation requiring a source of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378"
id="Page_378">[378]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377"></a></span>
heat. The large box wrench shown under the vise is used
for removing large special nuts and sometimes has one
end of the proper size to fit the valve chamber cap. The
piston ring removers are easily made from thin strips of
sheet metal securely brazed or soldered to a light wire
handle. These are used in sets of three for removing
and applying piston rings in a manner to be indicated.
The uses of the wrenches, screw drivers, and pliers shown
are known to all and the variety outlined should be sufficient
for all ordinary work of restoration. The wrench
equipment is very complete, including a set of open end
S-wrenches to fit all standard bolts, a spanner wrench,
socket or box wrenches for bolts that are inaccessible with
the ordinary type, adjustable end wrenches, a thin monkey
wrench of medium size, a bicycle wrench for handling
small nuts and bolts, a Stillson wrench for pipe and a
large adjustable monkey wrench for the stubborn fastenings
of large size.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;"><a name="Fig163" id="Fig163"></a>
<img src="images/illo372.png" alt="Fig. 163" width="350" height="604" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 163.&mdash;Practical Hand Tools Useful in Dismantling and Repairing
Airplane Engines.</p></div>

<p>Four different types of pliers are shown, one being a
parallel jaw type with size cutting attachment, while the
other illustrated near it is a combination parallel jaw type
adapted for use on round work as well as in handling
flat stock. The most popular form of pliers is the combination
pattern shown beneath the socket wrench set.
This is made of substantial drop forgings having a hinged
joint that can be set so that a very wide opening at the
jaws is possible. These can be used on round work and
for wire cutting as well as for handling flat work. Round
nose pliers are very useful also.</p>

<p>A very complete set of files, including square, half
round, mill, flat bastard, three-cornered and rat tail are
also necessary. A hacksaw frame and a number of saws,
some with fine teeth for tubing and others with coarser
teeth for bar or solid stock will be found almost indispensable.
A complete punch and chisel set should be provided,
samples of which are shown in the group while the
complete outfit is outlined in another illustration. A
number of different forms and sizes of chisels are necessary,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
as one type is not suitable for all classes of work.
The adjustable end wrenches can be used in many places
where a monkey wrench cannot be fitted and where it
will be difficult to use a wrench having a fixed opening.
The Stillson pipe wrench is useful in turning studs, round
rods, and pipes that cannot be turned by any other means.
A complete shop kit must necessarily include various sizes
for Stillson and monkey wrenches, as no one size can be
expected to handle the wide range of work the engine
repairman must cope with. Three sizes of each form of
wrench can be used, one, a 6 inch, is as small as is needed
while, a 12 inch tool will handle almost any piece of pipe
or nut used in engine construction.</p>

<p>Three or four sizes of hammers should be provided,
according to individual requirement, these being small
riveting, medium and heavyweight machinist&#8217;s hammers.
A very practical tool of this nature for the repair shop
can be used as a hammer, screw driver or pry iron. It is
known as the &#8220;Spartan&#8221; hammer and is a tool steel drop
forging in one piece having the working surfaces properly
hardened and tempered while the metal is distributed so
as to give a good balance to the head and a comfortable
grip to the handle. The hammer head provides a positive
and comfortable T-handle when the tool is used as
a screw driver or &#8220;tommy&#8221; bar. Machinist&#8217;s hammers
are provided with three types of heads, these being of
various weights. The form most commonly used is
termed the &#8220;ball pein&#8221; on account of the shape of the
portion used for riveting. The straight pein is just the
same as the cross pein, except that in the latter the
straight portion is at right angles to the hammer handle,
while in the former it is parallel to that member.</p>

<h3><a name="SecXI_2" id="SecXI_2"></a>FORMS OF WRENCHES</h3>

<p>Wrenches have been made in infinite variety and there
are a score or more patterns of different types of adjustable
socket and off-set wrenches. The various wrench<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
types that differ from the more conventional monkey
wrenches or those of the Stillson pattern are shown at
<a href="#Fig164">Fig. 164</a>. The &#8220;perfect handle&#8221; is a drop forged open
end form provided with a wooden handle similar to that
used on a monkey wrench in order to provide a better
grip for the hand. The &#8220;Saxon&#8221; wrench is a double
alligator form, so called because the jaws are in the form
of a V-groove having one side of the V plain, while the
other is serrated in order to secure a tight grip on round
objects. In the form shown, two jaws of varying sizes
are provided, one for large work, the other to handle the
smaller rods. One of the novel features in connection
with this wrench is the provision of a triple die block in
the centre of the handle which is provided with three
most commonly used of the standard threads including
<sup>5</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub>-inch-18, <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>-inch-16, and
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>-inch-13. This is useful in
cleaning up burred threads on bolts before they are
replaced, as burring is unavoidable if it has been necessary
to drive them out with a hammer. The &#8220;Lakeside&#8221;
wrench has an adjustable pawl engaging with one of a
series of notches by which the opening may be held in
any desired position.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="Fig164" id="Fig164"></a>
<img src="images/illo375.png" alt="Fig. 164" width="500" height="287" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 164.&mdash;Wrenches are Offered in Many Forms.</p></div>

<p>Ever since the socket wrench was invented it has been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
a popular form because it can be used in many places
where the ordinary open end or monkey wrench cannot
be applied owing to lack of room for the head of the
wrench. A typical set which has been made to fit in a very
small space is shown at D. It consists of a handle, which
is nickel-plated and highly polished, a long extension bar,
a universal joint and a number of case hardened cold
drawn steel sockets to fit all commonly used standard nuts
and bolt heads. Two screw-driver bits, one small and the
other large to fit the handle, and a long socket to fit spark-plugs
are also included in this outfit. The universal joint
permits one to remove nuts in a position that would be
inaccessible to any other form of wrench, as it enables
the socket to be turned even if the handle is at one side
of an intervening obstruction.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Pick-up&#8221; wrench, shown at E, is used for spark-plugs
and the upper end of the socket is provided with a
series of grooves into which a suitable blade carried by
the handle can be dropped. The handle is pivoted to the
top of the socket in such a way that the blades may be
picked up out of the grooves by lifting on the end of the
handle and dropped in again when the handle is swung
around to the proper point to get another hold on the
socket. The &#8220;Miller&#8221; wrench shown at F, is a combination
socket and open end type, made especially for use
with spark-plugs. Both the open end and the socket are
convenient. The &#8220;Handy&#8221; set shown at G, consists of a
number of thin stamped wrenches of steel held together
in a group by a simple clamp fitting, which enables either
end of any one of the four double wrenches to be brought
into play according to the size of the nut to be turned.
The &#8220;Cronk&#8221; wrench shown at H, is a simple stamping
having an alligator opening at one end and a stepped
opening capable of handling four different sizes of standard
nuts or bolt heads at the other. Such wrenches are
very cheap and are worth many times their small cost,
especially for fitting nuts where there is not sufficient
room to admit the more conventional pattern. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
&#8220;Starrett&#8221; wrench set, which is shown at I, consists of
a ratchet handle together with an extension bar and universal
joint, a spark-plug socket, a drilling attachment
which takes standard square shank drills from <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>-inch to
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>-inch in diameter, a double ended screw-driver bit and
several adjustments to go with the drilling attachment.
Twenty-eight assorted cold drawn steel sockets similar in
design to those shown at D, to fit all standard sizes of
square and hexagonal headed nuts are also included. The
reversible ratchet handle, which may be slipped over the
extension bar or the universal joint and which is also
adapted to take the squared end of any one of the sockets
is exceptionally useful in permitting, as it does, the instant
release of pressure when it is desired to swing the
handle back to get another hold on the nut. The socket
wrench sets are usually supplied in hard wood cases or
in leather bags so that they may be kept together and
protected against loss or damage. With a properly selected
socket wrench set, either of the ratchet handle or
T-handle form, any nut on the engine may be reached and
end wrenches will not be necessary.</p>

<h3><a name="SecXI_3" id="SecXI_3"></a>USE AND CARE OF FILES</h3>

<p>Mention has been previously made of the importance
of providing a complete set of files and suitable handles.
These should be in various grades or degrees of fineness
and three of each kind should be provided. In the flat
and half round files three grades are necessary, one with
coarse teeth for roughing, and others with medium and
fine teeth for the finishing cuts. The round or rat tail
file is necessary in filing out small holes, the half round
for finishing the interior of large ones. Half round files
are also well adapted for finishing surfaces of peculiar
contour, such as the inside of bearing boxes, connecting
rod and main bearing caps, etc. Square files are useful
in finishing keyways or cleaning out burred splines, while
the triangular section or three-cornered file is of value in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
cleaning out burred threads and sharp corners. Flat files
are used on all plane surfaces.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="Fig165" id="Fig165"></a>
<img src="images/illo378.png" alt="Fig. 165" width="400" height="494" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 165.&mdash;Illustrating Use and Care of Files.</p></div>

<p>The file brush shown at <a href="#Fig165">Fig. 165</a>, A, consists of a large
number of wire bristles attached to a substantial wood
back having a handle of convenient form so that the
bristles may be drawn through the interstices between
the teeth of the file to remove dirt and grease. If the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
teeth are filled with pieces of soft metal, such as solder
or babbitt, it may be necessary to remove this accumulation
with a piece of sheet metal as indicated at <a href="#Fig165">Fig.
165</a>, B. The method of holding a file for working on
plain surfaces when it is fitted with the regular form of
wooden handle is shown at C, while two types of handles
enabling the mechanic to use the flat file on plain surfaces
of such size that the handle type indicated at C,
could not be used on account of interfering with the surface
finished are shown at D. The method of using a
file when surfaces are finished by draw filing is shown at
E. This differs from the usual method of filing and is
only used when surfaces are to be polished and very little
metal removed.</p>

<h3><a name="SecXI_4" id="SecXI_4"></a>SPLIT PIN REMOVAL AND INSERTION</h3>

<p>One of the most widely used of the locking means to
prevent nuts or bolts from becoming loose is the simple
split pin, sometimes called a &#8220;cotter pin.&#8221; These can be
handled very easily if the special pliers shown at <a href="#Fig166">Fig.
166</a>, A, are used. They have a curved jaw that permits
of grasping the pin firmly and inserting it in the hole
ready to receive it. It is not easy to insert these split
pins by other means because the ends are usually spread
out and it is hard to enter the pin in the hole. With the
cotter pin pliers the ends may be brought close together
and as the plier jaws are small the pin may be easily
pushed in place. Another use of this plier, also indicated,
is to bend over the ends of the split pin in order to prevent
it from falling out. To remove these pins a simple
curved lever, as shown at <a href="#Fig166">Fig. 166</a>, B, is used. This has
one end tapering to a point and is intended to be inserted
in the eye of the cotter pin, the purchase offered
by the handle permitting of ready removal of the pin
after the ends have been closed by the cotter pin pliers.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="Fig166" id="Fig166"></a>
<img src="images/illo380.jpg" alt="Fig. 166" width="450" height="413" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 166.&mdash;Outlining Use of Cotter Pin Pliers, Spring Winder, and Showing
Practical Outfit of Chisels.</p></div>

<p class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></p>

<h3><a name="SecXI_5" id="SecXI_5"></a>COMPLETE CHISEL SET</h3>

<p>A complete chisel set suitable for repair shop use is
also shown at <a href="#Fig166">Fig. 166</a>. The type at C is known as a
&#8220;cape&#8221; chisel and has a narrow cutting point and is intended
to chip keyways, remove metal out of corners and
for all other work where the broad cutting edge chisel,
shown at D, cannot be used. The form with the wide
cutting edge is used in chipping, cutting sheet metal, etc.
At E, a round nose chisel used in making oil ways is outlined,
while a similar tool having a pointed cutting edge
and often used for the same purpose is shown at F. The
centre punch depicted at G, is very useful for marking
parts either for identification or for drilling. In addition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
to the chisels shown, a number of solid punches or drifts
resembling very much that shown at E, except that the
point is blunt should be provided to drive out taper pins,
bolts, rivets, and other fastenings of this nature. These
should be provided in the common sizes. A complete set
of real value would start at <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>-inch and increase by increments
of <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>32</sub>-inch up to <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>-inch. A simple spring winder
is shown at <a href="#Fig166">Fig. 166</a>, H, this making it possible for the
repairman to wind coil springs, either on the lathe or in
the vise. It will handle a number of different sizes of
wire and can be set to space the coils as desired.</p>

<h3><a name="SecXI_6" id="SecXI_6"></a>DRILLING MACHINES</h3>

<p>Drilling machines may be of two kinds, hand or power
operated. For drilling small holes in metal it is necessary
to run the drill fast, therefore the drill chuck is
usually driven by gearing in order to produce high drill
speed without turning the handle too fast. A small hand
drill is shown at <a href="#Fig167">Fig. 167</a>, A. As will be observed, the
chuck spindle is driven by a small bevel pinion, which in
turn, is operated by a large bevel gear turned by a crank.
The gear ratio is such that one turn of the handle will
turn the chuck five or six revolutions. A drill of this
design is not suited for drills any larger than one-quarter
inch. For use with drills ranging from one-eighth to
three-eighths, or even half-inch the hand drill presses
shown at C and D are used. These have a pad at the
upper end by which pressure may be exerted with the
chest in order to feed the drill into the work, and for
this reason they are termed &#8220;breast drills.&#8221; The form
at C has compound gearing, the drill chuck being driven
by the usual form of bevel pinion in mesh with a larger
bevel gear at one end of a countershaft. A small helical
spur pinion at the other end of this countershaft receives
its motion from a larger gear turned by the hand crank.
This arrangement of gearing permits of high spindle
speed without the use of large gears, as would be necessary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
if but two were used. The form at D gives two
speeds, one for use with small drills is obtained by engaging
the lower bevel pinion with the chuck spindle and
driving it by the large ring gear. The slow speed is obtained
by shifting the clutch so that the top bevel pinion
drives the drill chuck. As this meshes with a gear but
slightly larger in diameter, a slow speed of the drill
chuck is possible. Breast drills are provided with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
handle screwed into the side of the frame, these are used
to steady the drill press. For drilling extremely large
holes which are beyond the capacity of the usual form
of drill press the ratchet form shown at B, may be used
or the bit brace outlined at E. The drills used with either
of these have square shanks, whereas those used in the
drill presses have round shanks. The bit brace is also
used widely in wood work and the form shown is provided
with a ratchet by which the bit chuck may be turned
through only a portion of a revolution in either direction
if desired.</p>

<h3><a name="SecXI_7" id="SecXI_7"></a>DRILLS, REAMERS, TAPS AND DIES</h3>

<p>In addition to the larger machine tools and the simple
hand tools previously described, an essential item of equipment
of any engine or plane repair shop, even in cases
where the ordinary machine tools are not provided, is a
complete outfit of drills, reamers, and threading tools.
Drills are of two general classes, the flat and the twist
drills. The flat drill has an angle between cutting edges
of about 110 degrees and is usually made from special
steel commercially known as drill rod.</p>

<p>A flat drill cannot be fed into the work very fast because
it removes metal by a scraping, rather than a
cutting process. The twist drill in its simplest form is
cylindrical throughout the entire length and has spiral
flutes which are ground off at the end to form the cutting
lip and which also serve to carry the metal chips out of
the holes. The simplest form of twist drill used is shown
at <a href="#Fig168">Fig. 168</a>, C, and is known as a &#8220;chuck&#8221; drill, because
it must be placed in a suitable chuck to turn it. A twist
drill removes metal by cutting and it is not necessary to
use a heavy feed as the drill will tend to feed itself into
the work.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="Fig168" id="Fig168"></a>
<img src="images/illo384.png" alt="Fig. 168" width="450" height="392" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 168.&mdash;Forms of Drills Used in Hand and Power Drilling Machines.</p></div>

<p>Larger drills than <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>-inch are usually made with a
tapered shank as shown at <a href="#Fig168">Fig. 168</a>, B. At the end of
the taper a tongue is formed which engages with a suitable
opening in the collet, as the piece used to support<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
the drill is called. The object of this tongue is to relieve
the tapered portion of the drill from the stress of driving
by frictional contact alone, as this would not turn the
drill positively and the resulting slippage would wear the
socket, this depreciation changing the taper and making
it unfit for other drills. The tongue is usually proportioned
so it is adequate to drive the drill under any condition.
A small keyway is provided in the collet into which
a tapering key of flat stock may be driven against the
end of the tongue to drive the drill from the spindle. A
standard taper for drill shanks generally accepted by the
machine trade is known as the Morse and is a taper of
five-eighths of an inch to the foot. The Brown and Sharp
form tapers six-tenths of an inch to the foot. Care must
be taken, therefore, when purchasing drills and collets,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
to make sure that the tapers coincide, as no attempt
should be made to run a Morse taper in a Brown and
Sharp collet, or vice versa.</p>

<p>Sometimes cylindrical drills have straight flutes, as
outlined at <a href="#Fig168">Fig. 168</a>, A. Such drills are used with soft
metals and are of value when the drill is to pass entirely
through the work. The trouble with a drill with spiral
flutes is that it will tend to draw itself through as the
cutting lips break through. This catching of the drill
may break it or move the work from its position. With
a straight flute drill the cutting action is practically the
same as with the flat drill shown at <a href="#Fig168">Fig. 168</a>, E and F.</p>

<p>If a drill is employed in boring holes through close-grained,
tough metals, as wrought or malleable iron and
steel, the operation will be facilitated by lubricating the
drill with plenty of lard oil or a solution of soda and
water. Either of these materials will effectually remove
the heat caused by the friction of the metal removed
against the lips of the drill, and the danger of heating
the drill to a temperature that will soften it by drawing
the temper is minimized. In drilling large or deep holes
it is good practice to apply the lubricating medium directly
at the drill point. Special drills of the form shown
at <a href="#Fig168">Fig. 168</a>, B, having a spiral oil tube running in a
suitably formed channel, provides communication between
the point of the drill and a suitable receiving hole on a
drilled shank. The oil is supplied by a pump and its
pressure not only promotes positive circulation and removal
of heat, but also assists in keeping the hole free
of chips. In drilling steel or wrought iron, lard oil
applied to the point of the drill will facilitate the drilling,
but this material should never be used with either
brass or cast iron.</p>

<p>The sizes to be provided depend upon the nature of
the work and the amount of money that can be invested
in drills. It is common practice to provide a set of drills,
such as shown at <a href="#Fig169">Fig. 169</a>, which are carried in a suitable
metal stand, these being known as number drills on account<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
of conforming to the wire gauge standards. Number
drills do not usually run higher than <sup>5</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub> inch in
diameter. Beyond this point drills are usually sold by
the diameter. A set of chuck drills, ranging from <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> to
<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inch, advancing by <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>32</sub> inch, and a set of Morse taper
shank drills ranging from <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> to 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inches, by increments
of <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub> inch, will be all that is needed for the most pretentious
repair shop, as it is cheaper to bore holes larger
than 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inches with a boring tool than it is to carry a
number of large drills in stock that would be used very
seldom, perhaps not enough to justify their cost.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 169.&mdash;Useful Set of Number Drills, Showing Stand for Keeping These
in an Orderly Manner.</p></div>

<p>In grinding drills, care must be taken to have the
lips of the same length, so that they will form the same
angle with the axis. If one lip is longer than the other,
as shown in the flat drill at <a href="#Fig168">Fig. 168</a>, E, the hole will be
larger than the drill size, and all the work of cutting will
come upon the longest lip. The drill ends should be symmetrical,
as shown at <a href="#Fig168">Fig. 168</a>, F.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="Fig170" id="Fig170"></a>
<img src="images/illo387.png" alt="Fig. 170" width="400" height="398" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 170.&mdash;Illustrating Standard Forms of Hand and Machine Reamers.</p></div>

<p>It is considered very difficult to drill a hole to an exact
diameter, but for the most work a variation of a few
thousandths of an inch is of no great moment. Where
accuracy is necessary, holes must be reamed out to the
required size. In reaming, a hole is drilled about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>32</sub>
inch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
smaller than is required, and is enlarged with a cutting
tool known as the reamer. Reamers are usually of the
fluted form shown at <a href="#Fig170">Fig. 170</a>, A. Tools of this nature
are not designed to remove considerable amounts of
metal, but are intended to augment the diameter of the
drill hole by only a small fraction of an inch. Reamers
are tapered slightly at the point in order that they will
enter the hole easily, but the greater portion of the fluted
part is straight, all cutting edges being parallel. Hand
reamers are made in either the straight or taper forms,
that at A, <a href="#Fig170">Fig. 170</a>, being straight, while B has tapering
flutes. They are intended to be turned by a wrench similar
to that employed in turning a tap, as shown at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
<a href="#Fig172">Fig. 172</a>, C. The reamer shown at <a href="#Fig170">Fig. 170</a>, C, is a hand
reamer. The form at D has spiral flutes similar to a
twist drill, and as it is provided with a taper shank it is
intended to be turned by power through the medium of
a suitable collet.</p>

<p>As the solid reamers must become reduced in size
when sharpened, various forms of inserted blade reamers
have been designed. One of these is shown at E, and as
the cutting surfaces become reduced in diameter it is
possible to replace the worn blades with others of proper
size. Expanding reamers are of the form shown at F.
These have a bolt passing through that fits into a tapering
hole in the interior of the split reamer portion of the
tool. If the hole is to be enlarged a few thousandths of
an inch, it is possible to draw up on the nut just above
the squared end of the shank, and by drawing the tapering
wedge farther into the reamer body, the cutting portion
will be expanded and will cut a larger hole.</p>

<p>Reamers must be very carefully sharpened or there
will be a tendency toward chattering with a consequent
production of a rough surface. There are several methods
of preventing this chattering, one being to separate the
cutting edges by irregular spaces, while the most common
method, and that to be preferred on machine reamers, is
to use spiral flutes, as shown at <a href="#Fig170">Fig. 170</a>, D. Special
taper reamers are made to conform to the various taper
pin sizes which are sometimes used in holding parts together
in an engine. A taper of <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub> inch per foot is intended
for holes where a pin, once driven in, is to remain
in place. When it is desired that the pin be driven out,
the taper is made steeper, generally <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inch per foot,
which is the standard taper used on taper pins.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="Fig171" id="Fig171"></a>
<img src="images/illo389.png" alt="Fig. 171" width="400" height="345" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 171.&mdash;Tools for Thread Cutting.</p></div>

<p>When threads are to be cut in a small hole, it will be
apparent that it will be difficult to perform this operation
economically on a lathe, therefore when internal threading
is called for, a simple device known as a &#8220;tap&#8221; is
used. There are many styles of taps, all conforming to
different standards. Some are for metric or foreign<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
threads, some conform to the American standards, while
others are used for pipe and tubing. Hand taps are the
form most used in repair shops, these being outlined at
<a href="#Fig171">Fig. 171</a>, A and B. They are usually sold in sets of three,
known respectively as taper, plug, and bottoming. The
taper tap is the one first put into the hole, and is then
followed by the plug tap which cuts the threads deeper.
If it is imperative that the thread should be full size
clear to the bottom of the hole, the third tap of the set,
which is straight-sided, is used. It would be difficult to
start a bottoming tap into a hole because it would be
larger in diameter at its point than the hole. The taper
tap, as shown at A, <a href="#Fig171">Fig. 171</a>, has a portion of the cutting
lands ground away at the point in order that it will enter
the hole. The manipulation of a tap is not hard, as it
does not need to be forced into the work, as the thread<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
will draw it into the hole as the tap is turned. The
tapering of a tap is done so that no one thread is called
upon to remove all of the metal, as for about half way up
the length of the tap each succeeding thread is cut a
little larger by the cutting edge until the full thread
enters the hole. Care must be taken to always enter a
tap straight in order to have the thread at correct angles
to the surface.</p>

<p>In cutting external threads on small rods or on small
pieces, such as bolts and studs, it is not always economical
to do this work in the lathe, especially in repair work.
Dies are used to cut threads on pieces that are to be
placed in tapped holes that have been threaded by the
corresponding size of tap. Dies for small work are often
made solid, as shown at <a href="#Fig171">Fig. 171</a>, C, but solid dies are
usually limited to sizes below <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inch. Sometimes the
solid die is cylindrical in shape, with a slot through
one side which enables one to obtain a slight degree of
adjustment by squeezing the slotted portion together.
Large dies, or the sizes over <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inch, are usually made
in two pieces in order that the halves may be closed up
or brought nearer together. The advantage of this form
of die is that either of the two pieces may be easily sharpened,
and as it may be adjusted very easily the thread
may be cut by easy stages. For example, the die may be
adjusted to cut large, which will produce a shallow thread
that will act as an accurate guide when the die is closed
up and a deeper thread cut.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="Fig172" id="Fig172"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 172.&mdash;Showing Holder Designs for One- and Two-Piece Thread Cutting
Dies.</p></div>

<p>A common form of die holder for an adjustable die is
shown at <a href="#Fig172">Fig. 172</a>, A. As will be apparent, it consists
of a central body portion having guide members to keep
the die pieces from falling out and levers at each end in
order to permit the operator to exert sufficient force to
remove the metal. The method of adjusting the depth of
thread with a clamp screw when a two-piece die is employed
is also clearly outlined. The diestock shown at
B is used for the smaller dies of the one-piece pattern,
having a slot in order that they may be closed up slightly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
by the clamp screw. The reverse side of the diestock
shown at B is outlined below it, and the guide pieces,
which may be easily moved in or out, according to the
size of the piece to be threaded by means of eccentrically
disposed semi-circular slots in the adjustment plate, are
shown. These movable guide members have small pins
let into their surface which engage the slots, and they
may be moved in or out, as desired, according to the position
of the adjusting plate. The use of the guide pieces
makes for accurate positioning or centering of the rod to
be threaded. Dies are usually sold in sets, and are commonly
furnished as a portion of a complete outfit such as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
outlined at <a href="#Fig173">Fig. 173</a>. That shown has two sizes of diestock,
a tap wrench, eight assorted dies, eight assorted
taps, and a small screw driver for adjusting the die. An
automobile repair shop should be provided with three
different sets of taps and dies, as three different standards
for the bolts and nuts are used in fastening automobile
components. These are the American, metric
(used on foreign engines), and the S. A. E. standard
threads. A set of pipe dies and taps will also be found
useful.</p>

<h3><a name="SecXI_8" id="SecXI_8"></a>MEASURING TOOLS</h3>

<p>The tool outfit of the machinist or the mechanic who
aspires to do machine work must include a number of
measuring tools which are not needed by the floor man or
one who merely assembles and takes apart the finished
pieces. The machinist who must convert raw material
into finished products requires a number of measuring
tools, some of which are used for taking only approximate
measurements, such as calipers and scales, while
others are intended to take very accurate measurements,
such as the Vernier and the micrometer. A number of
common forms of calipers are shown at <a href="#Fig174">Fig. 174</a>. These
are known as inside or outside calipers, depending upon
the measurements they are intended to take. That at A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
is an inside caliper, consisting of two legs, A and D, and
a gauging piece, B, which can be locked to leg A, or released
from that member by the screw, C. The object of
this construction is to permit of measurements being
taken at the bottom of a two diameter hole, where the
point to be measured is of larger diameter than the portion
of the hole through which the calipers entered. It
will be apparent that the legs A and D must be brought
close together to pass through the smaller holes. This
may be done without losing the setting, as the guide bar
B will remain in one position as determined by the size
of the hole to be measured, while the leg A may be swung
in to clear the obstruction as the calipers are lifted out.
When it is desired to ascertain the measurements the leg
A is pushed back into place into the slotted portion of the
guide B, and locked by the clamp screw C. A tool of this
form is known as an internal transfer caliper.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="Fig174" id="Fig174"></a>
<img src="images/illo393.png" alt="Fig. 174" width="450" height="329" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 174.&mdash;Common Forms of Inside and Outside Calipers.</p></div>

<p>The form of caliper shown at B is an outside caliper.
Those at C and D are special forms for inside and outside<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
work, the former being used, if desired, as a divider,
while the latter may be employed for measuring the
walls of tubing. The calipers at E are simple forms,
having a friction joint to distinguish them from the spring
calipers shown at B, C and D. In order to permit of
ready adjustment of a spring caliper, a split nut as shown
at G is sometimes used. A solid nut caliper can only be
adjusted by screwing the nut in or out on the screw,
which may be a tedious process if the caliper is to be set
from one extreme to the other several times in succession.
With a slip nut as shown at G it is possible to slip it
from one end of the thread to the other without turning
it, and of locking it in place at any desired point by
simply allowing the caliper leg to come in contact with
it. The method of adjusting a spring caliper is shown
at <a href="#Fig174">Fig. 174</a>, H.</p>

<p>Among the most common of the machinist&#8217;s tools are
those used for linear measurements. The usual forms are
shown in group, <a href="#Fig175">Fig. 175</a>. The most common tool, which
is widely known, is the carpenter&#8217;s folding two-foot rule
or the yardstick. While these are very convenient for
taking measurements where great accuracy is not required,
the machinist must work much more accurately
than the carpenter, and the standard steel scale which is
shown at D, is a popular tool for the machinist. The
steel scale is in reality a graduated straight edge and
forms an important part of various measuring tools.
These are made of high grade steel and vary from 1 to
48 inches in length. They are carefully hardened in order
to preserve the graduations, and all surfaces and edges
are accurately ground to insure absolute parallelism. The
graduations on the high grade scales are produced with
a special device known as a dividing engine, but on
cheaper scales, etching suffices to provide a fairly accurate
graduation. The steel scales may be very thin and flexible,
or may be about an eighth of an inch thick on the
twelve-inch size, which is that commonly used with combination
squares, protractors and other tools of that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
nature. The repairman&#8217;s scale should be graduated both
with the English system, in which the inches are divided
into eighths, sixteenths, thirty-secondths and sixty-fourths,
and also in the metric system, divided into millimeters
and centimeters. Some machinists use scales
graduated in tenths, twentieths, fiftieths and hundredths.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
This is not as good a system of graduation as the more
conventional one first described.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="Fig175" id="Fig175"></a>
<img src="images/illo395.png" alt="Fig. 175" width="400" height="535" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 175.&mdash;Measuring Appliances for the Machinist and Floor Man.</p></div>

<p>Some steel scales are provided with a slot or groove
cut the entire length on one side and about the center of
the scales. This permits the attachment of various fittings
such as the protractor head, which enables the machinist
to measure angles, or in addition the heads convert
the scale into a square or a tool permitting the accurate
bisecting of pieces of circular section. Two scales are
sometimes joined together to form a right angle, such as
shown at <a href="#Fig175">Fig. 175</a>, C. This is known as a square and is
very valuable in ascertaining the truth of vertical pieces
that are supposed to form a right angle with a base piece.</p>

<p>The Vernier is a device for reading finer divisions on
a scale than those into which the scale is divided. Sixty-fourths
of an inch are about the finest division that can
be read accurately with the naked eye. When fine work
is necessary a Vernier is employed. This consists essentially
of two rules so graduated that the true scale has
each inch divided into ten equal parts, the upper or Vernier
portion has ten divisions occupying the same space
as nine of the divisions of the true scale. It is evident,
therefore, that one of the divisions of the Vernier is equal
to nine-tenths of one of those on the true scale. If the
Vernier scale is moved to the right so that the graduations
marked &#8220;1&#8221; shall coincide, it will have moved one-tenth
of a division on the scale or one-hundredth of an
inch. When the graduations numbered 5 coincide the
Vernier will have moved five-hundredths of an inch; when
the lines marked 0 and 10 coincide, the Vernier will have
moved nine-hundredths of an inch, and when 10 on the
Vernier comes opposite 10 on the scales, the upper rule
will have moved ten-hundredths of an inch, or the whole
of one division on the scale. By this means the scale,
though it may be graduated only to tenths of an inch,
may be accurately set at points with positions expressed
in hundredths of an inch. When graduated to read in
thousandths, the true scale is divided into fifty parts and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
the Vernier into twenty parts. Each division of the Vernier
is therefore equal to nineteen-twentieths of one of
the true scale. If the Vernier be moved so the lines of
the first division coincide, it will have moved one-twentieth
of one-fiftieth, or .001 inch. The Vernier principle
can be readily grasped by studying the section of the
Vernier scale and true scale shown at <a href="#Fig176">Fig. 176</a>, A.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="Fig176" id="Fig176"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 176.&mdash;At Left, Special Form of Vernier Caliper for Measuring Gear
Teeth; at Right, Micrometer for Accurate Internal Measurements.</p></div>

<p>The caliper scale which is shown at <a href="#Fig175">Fig. 175</a>, A, permits
of taking the over-all dimension of any parts that
will go between the jaws. This scale can be adjusted very
accurately by means of a fine thread screw attached to a
movable jaw and the divisions may be divided by eye
into two parts if one sixty-fourth is the smallest of the
divisions. A line is indicated on the movable jaw and
coincides with the graduations on the scale. As will be
apparent, if the line does not coincide exactly with one
of the graduations it will be at some point between the
lines and the true measurement may be approximated without
trouble.</p>

<p>A group of various other measuring tools of value to
the machinist is shown at <a href="#Fig177">Fig. 177</a>. The small scale at A
is termed a &#8220;center gauge,&#8221; because it can be used to
test<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
the truth of the taper of either a male or female lathe
center. The two smaller nicks, or v&#8217;s, indicate the shape
of a standard thread, and may be used as a guide for
grinding the point of a thread-cutting tool. The cross
level which is shown at B is of marked utility in erecting,
as it will indicate absolutely if the piece it is used to test
is level. It will indicate if the piece is level along its
width as well as its length.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="Fig177" id="Fig177"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 177.&mdash;Measuring Appliances of Value in Airplane Repair Work.</p></div>

<p>A very simple attachment for use with a scale that
enables the machinist to scribe lines along the length of
a cylindrical piece is shown at <a href="#Fig177">Fig. 177</a>, C. These are
merely small wedge-shaped clamps having an angular
face to rest upon the bars. The thread pitch gauge which
is shown at <a href="#Fig177">Fig. 177</a>, D, is an excellent pocket tool for the
mechanic, as it is often necessary to determine without
loss of time the pitch of the thread on a bolt or in a nut.
This consists of a number of leaves having serrations on

used in measuring. The tool shown gives all pitches up
to 48 threads per inch. The leaves may be folded in out
of the way when not in use, and their shape admits of
their being used in any position without the remainder
of the set interfering with the one in use. The fine pitch
gauges have slim, tapering leaves of the correct shape to
be used in finding the pitch of small nuts. As the tool is
round when the leaves are folded back out of the way, it
is an excellent pocket tool, as there are no sharp corners
to wear out the pocket. Practical application of a Vernier
having measuring heads of special form for measuring
gear teeth is shown at <a href="#Fig176">Fig. 176</a>, A. As the action of
this tool has been previously explained, it will not be
necessary to describe it further.</p>

<h3><a name="SecXI_9" id="SecXI_9"></a>MICROMETER CALIPERS AND THEIR USE</h3>

<p>Where great accuracy is necessary in taking measurements
the micrometer caliper, which in the simple form
will measure easily .001 inch (one-thousandth part of an
inch) and when fitted with a Vernier that will measure
.0001 inch (one ten-thousandth part of an inch), is used.
The micrometer may be of the caliper form for measuring
outside diameters or it may be of the form shown at
<a href="#Fig176">Fig. 176</a>, B, for measuring internal diameters. The operation
of both forms is identical except that the internal
micrometer is placed inside of the bore to be measured
while the external form is used just the same as a caliper.
The form outlined will measure from one and one-half to
six and a half inches as extension points are provided to
increase the range of the instrument. The screw has a
movement of one-half inch and a hardened anvil is placed
in the end of the thimble in order to prevent undue wear
at that point. The extension points or rods are accurately
made in standard lengths and are screwed into the body
of the instrument instead of being pushed in, this insuring
firmness and accuracy. Two forms of micrometers
for external measurements are shown at <a href="#Fig178">Fig. 178</a>.
The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
top one is graduated to read in thousandths of an inch,
while the lower one is graduated to indicate hundredths
of a millimeter. The mechanical principle involved in the
construction of a micrometer is that of a screw free to
move in a fixed nut. An opening to receive the work to
be measured is provided by the backward movement of the
thimble which turns the screw and the size of the opening
is indicated by the graduations on the barrel.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="Fig178" id="Fig178"></a>
<img src="images/illo400.png" alt="Fig. 178" width="400" height="473" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 178.&mdash;Standard Forms of Micrometer Caliper for External Measurements.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>The article to be measured is placed between the anvil
and spindle, the frame being held stationary while the
thimble is revolved by the thumb and finger. The pitch
of the screw thread on the concealed part of the spindle
is 40 to an inch. One complete revolution of the spindle,
therefore, moves it longitudinally one-fortieth, or twenty-five
thousandths of an inch. As will be evident from the
development of the scale on the barrel of the inch micrometer,
the sleeve is marked with forty lines to the
inch, each of these lines indicating twenty-five thousandths.
The thimble has a beveled edge which is graduated
into twenty-five parts. When the instrument is
closed the graduation on the beveled edge of the thimble
marked 0 should correspond to the 0 line on the barrel.
If the micrometer is rotated one full turn the opening
between the spindle and anvil will be .025 inch. If the
thimble is turned only one graduation, or one twenty-fifth
of a revolution, the opening between the spindle and
anvil will be increased only by .001 inch (one-thousandth
of an inch).</p>

<p>As many of the dimensions of the airplane parts,
especially of those of foreign manufacture or such parts
as ball and roller bearings, are based on the metric system,
the competent repairman should possess both inch
and metric micrometers in order to avoid continual reference
to a table of metric equivalents. With a metric micrometer
there are fifty graduations on the barrel, these
representing .01 of a millimeter, or approximately .004
inch. One full turn of the barrel means an increase of
half a millimeter, or .50 mm. (fifty one-hundredths). As
it takes two turns to augment the space between the anvil
and the stem by increments of one millimeter, it will be
evident that it would not be difficult to divide the spaces
on the metric micrometer thimble in halves by the eye,
and thus the average workman can measure to .0002 inch
plus or minus without difficulty. As set in the illustration,
the metric micrometers show a space of 13.5 mm.,
or about one millimeter more than half an inch. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
inch micrometer shown is set to five-tenths or five hundred
one-thousandths or one-half inch. A little study of
the foregoing matter will make it easy to understand the
action of either the inch or metric micrometer.</p>

<p>Both of the micrometers shown have a small knurled
knob at the end of the barrel. This controls the ratchet
stop, which is a device that permits a ratchet to slip by
a pawl when more than a certain amount of pressure is
applied, thereby preventing the measuring spindle from
turning further and perhaps springing the instrument. A
simple rule that can be easily memorized for reading the
inch micrometer is to multiply the number of vertical
divisions on the sleeve by 25 and add to that the number
of divisions on the bevel of the thimble reading from the
zero to the line which coincides with the horizontal line on
the sleeve. For example: if there are ten divisions visible
on the sleeve, multiply this number by 25, then add
the number of divisions shown on the bevel of the thimble,
which is 10. The micrometer is therefore opened
10 &times; 25 equals 250 plus 10 equals 260 thousandths.</p>

<p>Micrometers are made in many sizes, ranging from
those having a maximum opening of one inch to special
large forms that will measure forty or more inches.
While it is not to be expected that the repairman will have
use for the big sizes, if a caliper having a maximum
opening of six inches is provided with a number of extension
rods enabling one to measure smaller objects,
practically all of the measuring needed in repairing engine
parts can be made accurately. Two or three smaller
micrometers having a maximum range of two or three
inches will also be found valuable, as most of the measurements
will be made with these tools which will be much
easier to handle than the larger sizes.</p>

<h3><a name="SecXI_10" id="SecXI_10"></a>TYPICAL TOOL OUTFITS</h3>

<p>The equipment of tools necessary for repairing airplane
engines depends entirely upon the type of the power<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
plant and while the common hand tools can be used on
all forms, the work is always facilitated by having special
tools adapted for reaching the nuts and screws that would
be hard to reach otherwise. Special spanners and socket
wrenches are very desirable. Then again, the nature of
the work to be performed must be taken into consideration.
Rebuilding or overhauling an engine calls for considerably
more tools than are furnished for making field
repairs or minor adjustments. A complete set of tools
supplied to men working on Curtiss OX-2 engines and
JN-4 training biplanes is shown at <a href="#Fig179">Fig. 179</a>. The tools
are placed in a special box provided with a hinged cover
and are arranged in the systematic manner outlined.
The various tools and supplies shown are: A, hacksaw
blades; B, special socket wrenches for engine bolts and
nuts; C, ball pein hammers, four sizes; D, five assorted
sizes of screw drivers ranging from very long for heavy
work to short and small for fine work; E, seven pairs of
pliers including combination in three sizes, two pairs of
cutting pliers and one round nose; F, two split pin extractors
and spreaders; G, wrench set including three
adjustable monkey wrenches, one Stillson or pipe wrench,
five sizes adjustable end wrenches and ten double end
S wrenches; H, set of files, including flat, three cornered
and half round; I, file brush; J, chisel and drift pin;
K, three small punches or drifts; L, hacksaw frame; M,
soldering copper; N, special spanners for propeller retaining
nuts; O, special spanners; P, socket wrenches,
long handle; Q, long handle, stiff bristle brushes for
cleaning motor; R, gasoline blow torch; S, hand drill;
T, spools of safety wire; U, flash lamp; V, special puller
and castle wrenches; W, oil can; X, large adjustable
monkey wrench; Y, washer and gasket cutter; Z, ball of
heavy twine. In addition to the tools, various supplies,
such as soldering acid, solder, shellac, valve grinding compound,
bolts and nuts, split pins, washers, wood screws,
etc., are provided.</p>

<h3><a name="SecXI_12" id="SecXI_12"></a>OVERHAULING AIRPLANE ENGINES</h3>

<p>After an airplane engine has been in use for a period
ranging from 60 to 80 hours, depending upon the type,
it is necessary to give it a thorough overhauling before
it is returned to service. To do this properly, the engine
is removed from the fuselage and placed on a special supporting
stand, such as shown at <a href="#Fig181">Fig. 181</a>, so it can be
placed in any position and completely dismantled. With
a stand of this kind it is as easy to work on the bottom
of the engine as on the top and every part can be instantly
reached. The crank-case shown in place in illustration

the crank-shaft bearings.</p>

<p><a name="SecXI_13" id="SecXI_13"></a>In order to look over the parts of an engine and to
restore the worn or defective components it is necessary
to take the engine entirely apart, as it is only when the
power plant is thoroughly dismantled that the parts can
be inspected or measured to determine defects or wear.
If one is not familiar with the engine to be inspected,
even though the work is done by a repairman of experience,
it will be found of value to take certain precautions
when dismantling the engine in order to insure that all
parts will be replaced in the same position they occupied
before removal. There are a number of ways of identifying
the parts, one of the simplest and surest being to
mark them with steel numbers or letters or with a series
of center punch marks in order to retain the proper relation
when reassembling. This is of special importance
in connection with dismantling multiple cylinder engines
as it is vital that pistons, piston rings, connecting rods,
valves, and other cylinder parts be always replaced in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
the same cylinder from which they were removed, because
it is uncommon to find equal depreciation in all
cylinders. Some repairmen use small shipping tags to
identify the pieces. This can be criticised because the
tags may become detached and lost and the identity of
the piece mistaken. If the repairing is being done in a
shop where other engines of the same make are being
worked on, the repairman should be provided with a large
chest fitted with a lock and key in which all of the smaller
parts, such as rods, bolts and nuts, valves, gears, valve
springs, cam-shafts, etc., may be stored to prevent the
possibility of confusion with similar members of other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
engines. All parts should be thoroughly cleaned with
gasoline or in the potash kettle as removed, and wiped
clean and dry. This is necessary to show wear which will
be evidenced by easily identified indications in cases
where the machine has been used for a time, but in others,
the deterioration can only be detected by delicate measuring
instruments.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 181.&mdash;Special Stand to Make Motor Overhauling Work Easier.</p></div>

<p>In taking down a motor the smaller parts and fittings
such as spark-plugs, manifolds and wiring should be removed
first. Then the more important members such as cylinders
may be removed from the crank-case to give access
to the interior and make possible the examination of the
pistons, rings and connecting rods. After the cylinders are
removed the next operation is to disconnect the connecting
rods from the crank-shaft and to remove them and
the pistons attached as a unit. Then the crank-case is
dismembered, in most cases by removing the bottom half
or oil sump, thus exposing the main bearings and crank-shaft.
The first operation is the removal of the inlet and
exhaust manifolds. In some cases the manifolds are
cored integral with the cylinder head casting and it is
merely necessary to remove a short pipe leading from the
carburetor to one inlet opening and the exhaust pipe from
the outlet opening common to all cylinders. In order to
remove the carburetor it is necessary to shut off the gasoline
supply at the tank and to remove the pipe coupling
at the float chamber. It is also necessary to disconnect
the throttle operating rod. After the cylinders are removed
and before taking the crank-case apart it is well
to remove the water pump and magneto. The wiring on
most engines of modern development is carried in conduits
and usually releasing two or three minor fastenings
will permit one to take off the plug wiring as a unit.
The wire should be disconnected from both spark-plugs
and magneto distributor before its removal. When the
cylinders are removed, the pistons, piston rings, and connecting
rods are clearly exposed and their condition may
be readily noticed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>Before disturbing the arrangement of the timing
gears, it is important that these be marked so that they
will be replaced in exactly the same relation as intended
by the engine designer. If the gears are properly marked
the valve timing and magneto setting will be undisturbed
when the parts are replaced after overhauling. With the
cylinders off, it is possible to ascertain if there is any
undue wear present in the connecting rod bearings at
either the wrist pin or crank-pin ends and also to form
some idea of the amount of carbon deposits on the piston
top and back of the piston rings. Any wear of the timing
gears can also be determined. The removal of the
bottom plate of the engine enables the repairman to see
if the main bearings are worn unduly. Often bearings
may be taken up sufficiently to eliminate all looseness. In
other cases they may be worn enough so that careful
refitting will be necessary. Where the crank-case is
divided horizontally into two portions, the upper one
serving as an engine base to which the cylinders and in
fact all important working parts are attached, the lower
portion performs the functions of an oil container and
cover for the internal mechanism. This is the construction
generally followed.</p>

<h3><a name="SecXI_14" id="SecXI_14"></a>DEFECTS IN CYLINDERS</h3>

<p>After the cylinders have been removed and stripped
of all fittings, they should be thoroughly cleaned and then
carefully examined for defects. The interior or bore
should be looked at with a view of finding score marks,
grooves, cuts or scratches in the interior, because there
are many faults that may be ascribed to depreciation at
this point. The cylinder bore may be worn out of round,
which can only be determined by measuring with an internal
caliper or dial indicator even if the cylinder bore
shows no sign of wear. The flange at the bottom of the
cylinder by which it is held to the engine base may be
cracked. The water jacket wall may have opened up due<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
to freezing of the jacket water at some time or other or it
may be filled with scale and sediment due to the use of
impure cooling water. The valve seat may be scored or
pitted, while the threads holding the valve chamber cap
may be worn so that the cap will not be a tight fit. The
detachable head construction makes it possible to remove
that member and obtain ready access to the piston tops
for scraping out carbon without taking the main cylinder
portion from the crank-case. When the valves need grinding
the head may be removed and carried to the bench
where the work may be performed with absolute assurance
that none of the valve grinding compound will penetrate
into the interior of the cylinder as is sometimes unavoidable
with the I-head cylinder. If the cylinder should be
scored, the water jacket and combustion head may be
saved and a new cylinder casting purchased at considerably
less cost than that of the complete unit cylinder.</p>

<p>The detachable head construction has only recently
been applied on airplane engines, though it was one of
the earliest forms of automobile engine construction. In
the early days it was difficult to procure gaskets or packings
that would be both gas and water tight. The sheet
asbestos commonly used was too soft and blew out readily.
Besides a new gasket had to be made every time
the cylinder head was removed. Woven wire and asbestos
packings impregnated with rubber, red lead, graphite and
other filling materials were more satisfactory than the
soft sheet asbestos, but were prone to burn out if the
water supply became low. Materials such as sheet copper
or brass proved to be too hard to form a sufficiently yielding
packing medium that would allow for the inevitable
slight inaccuracies in machining the cylinder head and
cylinder. The invention of the copper-asbestos gasket,
which is composed of two sheets of very thin, soft copper
bound together by a thin edging of the same material
and having a piece of sheet asbestos interposed solved
this problem. Copper-asbestos packings form an effective
seal against leakage of water and a positive retention<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
means for keeping the explosion pressure in the
cylinder. The great advantage of the detachable head is
that it permits of very easy inspection of the piston tops
and combustion chamber and ready removal of carbon
deposits.</p>

<h3><a name="SecXI_15" id="SecXI_15"></a>CARBON DEPOSITS, THEIR CAUSE AND PREVENTION</h3>

<p>Most authorities agree that carbon is the result of
imperfect combustion of the fuel and air mixture as well
as the use of lubricating oils of improper flash point.
Lubricating oils that work by the piston rings may become
decomposed by the great heat in the combustion
chamber, but at the same time one cannot blame the lubricating
oil for all of the carbon deposits. There is little
reason to suspect that pure petroleum oil of proper body
will deposit excessive amounts of carbon, though if the
oil is mixed with castor oil, which is of vegetable origin,
there would be much carbon left in the interior of the
combustion chamber. Fuel mixtures that are too rich in
gasoline also produce these undesirable accumulations.</p>

<p>A very interesting chemical analysis of a sample of
carbon scraped from the interior of a motor vehicle engine
shows that ordinarily the lubricant is not as much
to blame as is commonly supposed. The analysis was
as follows:</p>

<table class="fsize80" summary="Table p. 418">

<tr>
<td class="left padr5">Oil</td>
<td class="right padl5">14.3</td>
<td class="left">%</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="left padr5">Other combustible matter</td>
<td class="right padl5">17.9</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="left padr5">Sand, clay, etc.</td>
<td class="right padl5">24.8</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="left padr5">Iron oxide</td>
<td class="right padl5">24.5</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="left padr5">Carbonate of lime</td>
<td class="right padl5">8.9</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="left padr5">Other constituents</td>
<td class="right padl5">9.6</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>It is extremely probable that the above could be divided
into two general classes, these being approximately
32.2% oil and combustible matter and a much larger
proportion, or 67.8% of earthy matter. The presence of
such a large percentage of earthy matter is undoubtedly
due to the impurities in the air, such as road dust which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
has been sucked in through the carburetor. The fact that
over 17% of the matter which is combustible was not of
an oily nature lends strong support to this view. There
would not be the amount of earthy material present in
the carbon deposits of an airplane engine as above stated
because the air is almost free from dust at the high altitudes
planes are usually flown. One could expect to find
more combustible and less earthy matter and the carbon
would be softer and more easily removed. It is very good
practice to provide a screen on the air intake to reduce
the amounts of dust sucked in with the air as well as
observing the proper precautions relative to supplying
the proper quantities of air to the mixture and of not
using any more oil than is needed to insure proper lubrication
of the internal mechanism.</p>

<h3><a name="SecXI_16" id="SecXI_16"></a>USE OF CARBON SCRAPERS</h3>

<p>It is not unusual for one to hear an aviator complain
that the engine he operates is not as responsive as it was
when new after he has run it but relatively few hours.
There does not seem to be anything actually wrong with
the engine, yet it does not respond readily to the throttle
and is apt to overheat. While these symptoms denote a
rundown condition of the mechanism, the trouble is often
due to nothing more serious than accumulations of carbon.
The remedy is the removal of this matter out of
place. The surest way of cleaning the inside of the motor
thoroughly is to remove the cylinders, if these members
are cast integrally with the head or of removing the head
member if that is a separate casting, to expose all parts.</p>

<p>In certain forms of cylinders, especially those of the
L form, it is possible to introduce simple scrapers down
through the valve chamber cap holes and through the
spark-plug hole if this component is placed in the cylinder
in some position that communicates directly to the
interior of the cylinder or to the piston top. No claim
can be made for originality or novelty of this process as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
is has been used for many years on large stationary engines.
The first step is to dismantle the inlet and exhaust
piping and remove the valve caps and valves, although
if the deposit is not extremely hard or present
in large quantities one can often manipulate the scrapers
in the valve cap openings without removing either the
piping or the valves. Commencing with the first cylinder,
the crank-shaft is turned till the piston is at the top of
its stroke, then the scraper may be inserted, and the
operation of removing the carbon started by drawing the
tool toward the opening. As this is similar to a small
hoe, the cutting edge will loosen some of the carbon and
will draw it toward the opening. A swab is made of a
piece of cloth or waste fastened at the end of a wire and
well soaked in kerosene to clean out the cylinder.</p>

<p>When available, an electric motor with a length of
flexible shaft and a small circular cleaning brush having
wire bristles can be used in the interior of the engine.
The electric motor need not be over one-eighth horsepower
running 1,200 to 1,600 R.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;M., and the wire brush
must, of course, be of such size that it can be easily inserted
through the valve chamber cap. The flexible shaft
permits one to reach nearly all parts of the cylinder interior
without difficulty and the spreading out and flattening
of the brush insures that considerable surface will be
covered by that member.</p>

<h3><a name="SecXI_17" id="SecXI_17"></a>BURNING OUT CARBON WITH OXYGEN</h3>

<p>A process of recent development that gives very good
results in removing carbon without disassembling the
motor depends on the process of burning out that material
by supplying oxygen to support the combustion
and to make it energetic. A number of concerns are already
offering apparatus to accomplish this work, and in
fact any shop using an autogenous welding outfit may
use the oxygen tank and reducing valve in connection
with a simple special torch for burning the carbon. Results<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
have demonstrated that there is little danger of
damaging the motor parts, and that the cost of oxygen
and labor is much lower than the old method of removing
the cylinders and scraping the carbon out, as well as
being very much quicker than the alternative process of
using carbon solvent. The only drawback to this system
is that there is no absolute insurance that every particle
of carbon will be removed, as small protruding particles
may be left at points that the flame does not reach and
cause pre-ignition and consequent pounding, even after
the oxygen treatment. It is generally known that carbon
will burn in the presence of oxygen, which supports combustion
of all materials, and this process takes advantage
of this fact and causes the gas to be injected into the
combustion chamber over a flame obtained by a match or
wax taper.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a name="Fig182" id="Fig182"></a>
<img src="images/illo416.png" alt="Fig. 182" width="600" height="354" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 182.&mdash;Showing Where Carbon Deposits Collect in Engine Combustion
Chamber, and How to Burn Them Out with the Aid of Oxygen. A&mdash;Special
Torch. B&mdash;Torch Coupled to Oxygen Tank. C&mdash;Torch in Use.</p></div>

<p>It is suggested by those favoring this process that
the night before the oxygen is to be used the engine be
given a conventional kerosene treatment. A half tumbler
full of this liquid or of denatured alcohol is to be poured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
into each cylinder and permitted to remain there over
night. As a precaution against fire, the gasoline is shut
off from the carburetor before the torch is inserted in
the cylinder and the motor started so that the gasoline in
the pipe and carburetor float chamber will be consumed.
Work is done on one cylinder at a time. A note of caution
was recently sounded by a prominent spark-plug
manufacturer recommending that the igniter member be
removed from the cylinder in order not to injure it by
the heat developed. The outfits on the market consist
of a special torch having a trigger controlled valve and
a length of flexible tubing such as shown at <a href="#Fig182">Fig. 182</a>, A,
and a regulating valve and oxygen tank as shown at B.
The gauge should be made to register about twelve
pounds pressure.</p>

<p>The method of operation is very simple and is outlined
at C. The burner tube is placed in the cylinder and
the trigger valve is opened and the oxygen permitted to
circulate in the combustion chamber. A lighted match
or wax taper is dropped in the chamber and the injector
tube is moved around as much as possible so as to cover
a large area. The carbon takes fire and burns briskly in
the presence of the oxygen. The combustion of the carbon
is accompanied by sparks and sometimes by flame if
the deposit is of an oily nature. Once the carbon begins
to burn the combustion continues without interruption as
long as the oxygen flows into the cylinder. Full instructions
accompany each outfit and the amount of pressure
for which the regulator should be set depends upon the
design of the torch and the amount of oxygen contained
in the storage tank.</p>

<h3><a name="SecXI_18" id="SecXI_18"></a>REPAIRING SCORED CYLINDERS</h3>

<p>If the engine has been run at any time without adequate
lubrication, one or more of the cylinders may be
found to have vertical scratches running up and down
the cylinder walls. The depth of these will vary according<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
to the amount of time the cylinder was without lubrication,
and if the grooves are very deep the only remedy
is to purchase a new member. Of course, if sufficient
stock is available in the cylinder walls, the cylinders may
be rebored and new pistons which are oversize, <i>i.e.</i>, larger
than standard, may be fitted. Where the scratches are
not deep they may be ground out with a high speed emery
wheel or lapped out if that type of machine is not available.
Wrist pins have been known to come loose, especially
when these are retained by set screws that are not
properly locked, and as wrist-pins are usually of hardened
steel it will be evident that the sharp edge of that
member can act as a cutting tool and make a pronounced
groove in the cylinder. Cylinder grinding is a job that
requires skilled mechanics, but may be accomplished on
any lathe fitted with an internal grinding attachment.
While automobile engine cylinders usually have sufficient
wall thickness to stand reboring, those of airplane engines
seldom have sufficient metal to permit of enlarging the
bore very much by a boring tool. A few thousandths of
an inch may be ground out without danger, however.
An airplane engine cylinder with deep grooves must be
scrapped as a general rule.</p>

<p>Where the grooves in the cylinder are not deep or
where it has warped enough so the rings do not bear
equally at all parts of the cylinder bore, it is possible to
obtain a fairly accurate degree of finish by a lapping process
in which an old piston is coated with a mixture of
fine emery and oil and is reciprocated up and down in the
cylinder as well as turned at the same time. This may
be easily done by using a dummy connecting rod having
only a wrist pin end boss, and of such size at the other
end so that it can be held in the chuck of a drill press.
The cylinder casting is firmly clamped on the drill press
table by suitable clamping blocks, and a wooden block is
placed in the combustion chamber to provide a stop for
the piston at its lower extreme position. The back gears
are put in and the drill chuck is revolved slowly. All the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
while that the piston is turning the drill chuck should be
raised up and down by the hand feed lever, as the best
results are obtained when the lapping member is given
a combination of rotary and reciprocating motion.</p>

<h3><a name="SecXI_19" id="SecXI_19"></a>VALVE REMOVAL AND INSPECTION</h3>

<p>One of the most important parts of the gasoline engine
and one that requires frequent inspection and refitting
to keep in condition, is the mushroom or poppet valve
that controls the inlet and exhaust gas flow. In overhauling
it is essential that these valves be removed from
their seatings and examined carefully for various defects
which will be enumerated at proper time. The problem
that concerns us now is the best method of removing the
valve. These are held against the seating in the cylinder
by a coil spring which exerts its pressure on the cylinder
casting at the upper end and against a suitable collar
held by a key at the lower end of the valve stem. In
order to remove the valve it is necessary to first compress
the spring by raising the collar and pulling the
retaining key out of the valve stem. Many forms of valve
spring lifters have been designed to permit ready removal
of the valves.</p>

<p>When the cylinder is of the valve in-the-head form,
the method of valve removal will depend entirely upon
the system of cylinder construction followed. In the
Sturtevant cylinder design it is possible to remove the
head from the cylinder castings and the valve springs
may be easily compressed by any suitable means when
the cylinder head is placed on the work bench where it
can be easily worked on. The usual method is to place
the head on a soft cloth with the valves bearing against
the bench. The valve springs may then be easily pushed
down with a simple forked lever and the valve stem key
removed to release the valve spring collar. In the Curtiss
OX-2 (see <a href="#Fig182a">Fig. 182<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub></a>) and Hall-Scott engines it is not
possible to remove the valves without taking the cylinder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
off the crank-case, because the valve seats are machined
directly in the cylinder head and the valve domes are cast
integrally with the cylinder. This means that if the valves
need grinding the cylinder must be removed from the
engine base to provide access to the valve heads which
are inside of that member, and which cannot be reached
from the outside as is true of the L-cylinder construction.
In the Curtiss VX engines, the valves are carried in detachable
cages which may be removed when the valves
need attention.</p>

<h3><a name="SecXI_20" id="SecXI_20"></a>RESEATING AND TRUING VALVES</h3>

<p>Much has been said relative to valve grinding, and
despite the mass of information given in the trade prints<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
it is rather amusing to watch the average repairman or the
engine user who prides himself on maintaining his own
motor performing this essential operation. The common
mistakes are attempting to seat a badly grooved or pitted
valve head on an equally bad seat, which is an almost
hopeless job, and of using coarse emery and bearing down
with all one&#8217;s weight on the grinding tool with the hope
of quickly wearing away the rough surfaces. The use of
improper abrasive material is a fertile cause of failure
to obtain a satisfactory seating. Valve grinding is not a
difficult operation if certain precautions are taken before
undertaking the work. The most important of these is
to ascertain if the valve head or seat is badly scored or
pitted. If such is found to be the case no ordinary
amount of grinding will serve to restore the surfaces. In
this event the best thing to do is to remove the valve
from its seating and to smooth down both the valve head
and the seat in the cylinder before attempt is made to
fit them together by grinding. Another important precaution
is to make sure that the valve stem is straight,
and that the head is not warped out of shape.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="Fig183" id="Fig183"></a>
<img src="images/illo422.jpg" alt="Fig. 183" width="400" height="535" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 183.&mdash;Tools for Restoring Valve Head and Seats.</p></div>

<p>A number of simple tools is available at the present
time for reseating valves, these being outlined at <a href="#Fig183">Fig.
183</a>. That shown at A is a simple fixture for facing off
the valve head. The stem is supported by suitable bearings
carried by the body or shank of the tool, and the
head is turned against an angularly disposed cutter which
is set for the proper valve seat angle. The valve head
is turned by a screw-driver, the amount of stock removed
from the head depending upon the location of the adjusting
screw. Care must be taken not to remove too much
metal, only enough being taken off to remove the most
of the roughness. Valves are made in two standard
tapers, the angle being either 45 or 60 degrees. It is imperative
that the cutter blade be set correctly in order
that the bevel is not changed. A set of valve truing and
valve-seat reaming cutters is shown at <a href="#Fig183">Fig. 183</a>, B. This
is adaptable to various size valve heads, as the cutter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
blade D may be moved to correspond to the size of the
valve head being trued up. These cutter blades are made
of tool steel and have a bevel at each end, one at 45 degrees,
the other at 60 degrees. The valve seat reamer
shown at G will take any one of the heads shown at F.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
It will also take any one of the guide bars shown at H.
The function of the guide bars is to fit the valve stem
bearing in order to locate the reamer accurately and to
insure that the valve seat is machined concentrically with
its normal center. Another form of valve seat reamer
and a special wrench used to turn it is shown at C. The
valve head truer shown at <a href="#Fig183">Fig. 183</a>, D, is intended to be
placed in a vise and is adaptable to a variety of valve
head sizes. The smaller valves merely fit deeper in the
conical depression. The cutter blade is adjustable and
the valve stem is supported by a simple self-centering
bearing. In operation it is intended that the valve stem,
which protrudes through the lower portion of the guide
bearing, shall be turned by a drill press or bit stock while
the valve head is set against the cutter by pressure of a
pad carried at the end of a feed screw which is supported
by a hinged bridge member. This can be swung out of
place as indicated to permit placing the valve head against
the cutter or removing it.</p>

<p>As the sizes of valve heads and stems vary considerably
a &#8220;Universal&#8221; valve head truing tool must have
some simple means of centering the valve stem in order
to insure concentric machining of the valve head. A valve
head truer which employs an ingenious method of guiding
the valve stem is shown at <a href="#Fig183">Fig. 183</a>, E. The device
consists of a body portion, B, provided with an external
thread at the top on which the cutter head, A, is screwed.
A number of steel balls, C, are carried in the grooves
which may be altered in size by the adjustment nut, F,
which screws in the bottom of the body portion, B. As
the nut F is screwed in against the spacer member E,
the V-grooves are reduced in size and the steel balls, C,
are pressed out in contact with the valve stem. As the
circle or annulus is filled with balls in both upper and
lower portions the stem may be readily turned because
it is virtually supported by ball bearing guides. When
a larger valve stem is to be supported, the adjusting nut
F, is screwed out which increases the size of the grooves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
and permits the balls, C, to spread out and allow the larger
stem to be inserted.</p>

<h3><a name="SecXI_21" id="SecXI_21"></a>VALVE GRINDING PROCESSES</h3>

<p>Mention has been previously made of the importance
of truing both valve head and seat before attempt is made
to refit the parts by grinding. After smoothing the valve
seat the next step is to find some way of turning the valve.
Valve heads are usually provided with a screw-driver slot
passing through the boss at the top of the valve or with
two drilled holes to take a forked grinding tool. A combination
grinding tool has been devised which may be
used when either the two drilled holes or the slotted head
form of valve is to be rotated. This consists of a special
form of screw driver having an enlarged boss just above
the blade, this boss serving to support a U-shape piece
which can be securely held in operative position by the
clamp screw or which can be turned out of the way if
the screw driver blade is to be used.</p>

<p>As it is desirable to turn the valve through a portion
of a revolution and back again rather than turning it
always in the same direction, a number of special tools
has been designed to make this oscillating motion possible
without trouble. A simple valve grinding tool is shown
at <a href="#Fig184">Fig. 184</a>, C. This consists of a screw-driver blade
mounted in a handle in such a way that the end may
turn freely in the handle. A pinion is securely fastened
to the screw-driver blade shank, and is adapted to fit a
race provided with a wood handle and guided by a bent
bearing member securely fastened to the screw-driver
handle. As the rack is pushed back and forth the pinion
must be turned first in one direction and then in the other.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="Fig184" id="Fig184"></a>
<img src="images/illo425.png" alt="Fig. 184" width="450" height="594" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 184.&mdash;Tools and Processes Utilized in Valve Grinding.</p></div>

<p>A valve grinding tool patterned largely after a breast
drill is shown at <a href="#Fig184">Fig. 184</a>, D. This is worked in such a
manner that a continuous rotation of the operating crank
will result in an oscillating movement of the chuck carrying
the screw-driver blade. The bevel pinions which are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
used to turn the chuck are normally free unless clutched
to the chuck stem by the sliding sleeve which must turn
with the chuck stem and which carries clutching members
at each end to engage similar members on the bevel pinions
and lock these to the chuck stem, one at a time. The
bevel gear carries a cam-piece which moves the clutch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
sleeve back and forth as it revolves. This means that the
pinion giving forward motion of the chuck is clutched to
the chuck spindle for a portion of a revolution of the
gear and clutch sleeve is moved back by the cam and
clutched to the pinion giving a reverse motion of the
chuck during the remainder of the main drive gear revolution.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens that the adjusting screw on the
valve lift plunger or the valve lift plunger itself when
L head cylinders are used does not permit the valve head
to rest against the seat. It will be apparent that unless
a definite space exists between the end of the valve stem
and the valve lift plunger that grinding will be of little
avail because the valve head will not bear properly
against the abrasive material smeared on the valve seat.</p>

<p>The usual methods of valve grinding are clearly outlined
at <a href="#Fig184">Fig. 184</a>. The view at the left shows the method
of turning the valve by an ordinary screw driver and also
shows a valve head at A, having both the drilled holes
and the screw-driver slot for turning the member and two
special forms of fork-end valve grinding tools. In the
sectional view shown at the right, the use of the light
spring between the valve head and the bottom of the valve
chamber to lift the valve head from the seat whenever
pressure on the grinding tool is released is clearly indicated.
It will be noted also that a ball of waste or cloth
is interposed in the passage between the valve chamber
and the cylinder interior to prevent the abrasive material
from passing into the cylinder from the valve chamber.
When a bitstock is used, instead of being given a true
rotary motion the chuck is merely oscillated through the
greater part of the circle and back again. It is necessary
to lift the valve from its seat frequently as the grinding
operation continues; this is to provide an even distribution
of the abrasive material placed between the valve
head and its seat. Only sufficient pressure is given to
the bitstock to overcome the uplift of the spring and to
insure that the valve will be held against the seat. Where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
the spring is not used it is possible to raise the valve
from time to time with the hand which is placed under
the valve stem to raise it as the grinding is carried on.
It is not always possible to lift the valve in this manner
when the cylinders are in place on the engine base owing
to the space between the valve lift plunger and the end
of the valve stem. In this event the use of the spring as
shown in sectional view will be desirable.</p>

<p>The abrasive generally used is a paste made of
medium or fine emery and lard oil or kerosene. This is
used until the surfaces are comparatively smooth, after
which the final polish or finish is given with a paste of
flour emery, grindstone dust, crocus, or ground glass and
oil. An erroneous impression prevails in some quarters
that the valve head surface and the seating must have
a mirror-like polish. While this is not necessary it is
essential that the seat in the cylinder and the bevel surface
of the head be smooth and free from pits or scratches
at the completion of the operation. All traces of the
emery and oil should be thoroughly washed out of the
valve chamber with gasoline before the valve mechanism
is assembled and in fact it is advisable to remove the old
grinding compound at regular intervals, wash the seat
thoroughly and supply fresh material as the process is in
progress.</p>

<p>The truth of seatings may be tested by taking some
Prussian blue pigment and spreading a thin film of it
over the valve seat. The valve is dropped in place and
is given about one-eighth turn with a little pressure on
the tool. If the seating is good both valve head and seat
will be covered uniformly with color. If high spots exist,
the heavy deposit of color will show these while the low
spots will be made evident because of the lack of pigment.
The grinding process should be continued until
the test shows an even bearing of the valve head at all
points of the cylinder seating. When the valves are held
in cages it is possible to catch the cage in a vise and to
turn the valve in any of the ways indicated. It is much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
easier to clean off the emery and oil and there is absolutely
no danger of getting the abrasive material in the
cylinder if the construction is such that the valve cage
or cylinder head member carrying the valve can be removed
from the cylinder. When valves are held in cages,
the tightness of the seat may be tested by partially filling
the cage with gasoline and noticing how much liquid oozes
out around the valve head. The degree of moisture present
indicates the efficacy of the grinding process.</p>

<p>The valves of Curtiss OX-2 cylinders are easily
ground in by using a simple fixture or tool and working
from the top of the cylinder instead of from the inside.
A tube having a bore just large enough to go over the
valve stem is provided with a wooden handle or taped at
one end and a hole of the same size as that drilled through
the valve stem is put in at the other. To use, the open
end of the tube is pushed over the valve stem and a split
pin pushed through the tube and stem. The valve may
be easily manipulated and ground in place by oscillating
in the customary manner.</p>

<h3><a name="SecXI_22" id="SecXI_22"></a>DEPRECIATION IN VALVE OPERATING SYSTEMS</h3>

<p>There are a number of points to be watched in the
valve operating system because valve timing may be seriously
interfered with if there is much lost motion at the
various bearing points in the valve lift mechanism. The
two conventional methods of opening valves are shown at
<a href="#Fig185">Fig. 185</a>. That at A is the type employed when the valve
cages are mounted directly in the head, while the form at
B is the system used when the valves are located in a
pocket or extension of the cylinder casting as is the case
if an L, or T-head cylinder is used. It will be evident
that there are several points where depreciation may take
place. The simplest form is that shown at B, and even on
this there are five points where lost motion may be noted.
The periphery of the valve opening cam or roller may be
worn, though this is not likely unless the roller or cam has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
been inadvertently left soft. The pin which acts as a
bearing for the roller may become worn, this occurring
quite often. Looseness may materialize between the bearing
surfaces of the valve lift plunger and the plunger
guide casting, and there may also be excessive clearance
between the top of the plunger and the valve stem.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="Fig185" id="Fig185"></a>
<img src="images/illo429.png" alt="Fig. 185" width="400" height="442" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 185.&mdash;Outlining Points in Valve Operating Mechanism Where Depreciation
is Apt to Exist.</p></div>

<p>On the form shown at A, there are several parts added
to those indicated at B. A walking beam or rocker lever
is necessary to transform the upward motion of the tappet
rod to a downward motion of the valve stem. The pin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
on which this member fulcrums may wear as will also the
other pin acting as a hinge or bearing for the yoke end
of the tappet rod. It will be apparent that if slight play
existed at each of the points mentioned it might result in
a serious diminution of valve opening. Suppose, for example,
that there were .005-inch lost motion at each of
three bearing points, the total lost motion would be .015-inch
or sufficient to produce noisy action of the valve
mechanism. When valve plungers of the adjustable form,
such as shown at B, are used, the hardened bolt head in
contact with the end of the valve stem may become hollowed
out on account of the hammering action at that
point. It is imperative that the top of this member be
ground off true and the clearance between the valve stem
and plunger properly adjusted. If the plunger is a non-adjustable
type it will be necessary to lengthen the valve
stem by some means in order to reduce the excessive
clearance. The only remedy for wear at the various
hinges and bearing pins is to bore the holes out slightly
larger and to fit new hardened steel pins of larger diameter.
Depreciation between the valve plunger guide and
the valve plunger is usually remedied by fitting new
plunger guides in place of the worn ones. If there is
sufficient stock in the plunger guide casting as is sometimes
the case when these members are not separable from
the cylinder casting, the guide may be bored out and
bushed with a light bronze bushing.</p>

<p>A common cause of irregular engine operation is due to
a sticking valve. This may be owing to a bent valve stem,
a weak or broken valve spring or an accumulation of
burnt or gummed oil between the valve stem and the
valve stem guide. In order to prevent this the valve stem
must be smoothed with fine emery cloth and no burrs or
shoulders allowed to remain on it, and the stem must also
be straight and at right angles to the valve head. If the
spring is weak it may be strengthened in some cases by
stretching it out after annealing so that a larger space
will exist between the coils and re-hardening. Obviously<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
if a spring is broken the only remedy is replacement of
the defective member.</p>

<p>Mention has been made of wear in the valve stem
guide and its influence on engine action. When these
members are an integral part of the cylinder the only
method of compensating for this wear is to drill the guide
out and fit a bushing, which may be made of steel tube.</p>

<p>In some engines, especially those of recent development,
the valve stem guide is driven or screwed into the
cylinder casting and is a separate member which may be
removed when worn and replaced with a new one. When
the guides become enlarged to such a point that considerable
play exists between them and the valve stems,
they may be easily knocked out or unscrewed.</p>

<h3><a name="SecXI_23" id="SecXI_23"></a>PISTON TROUBLES</h3>

<p>If an engine has been entirely dismantled it is very
easy to examine the pistons for deterioration. While it
is important that the piston be a good fit in the cylinder
it is mainly upon the piston rings that compression depends.
The piston should fit the cylinder with but little
looseness, the usual practice being to have the piston
about .001-inch smaller than the bore for each inch of
piston diameter at the point where the least heat is present
or at the bottom of the piston. It is necessary to
allow more than this at the top of the piston owing to its
expansion due to the direct heat of the explosion. The
clearance is usually graduated and a piston that would be
.005-inch smaller than the cylinder bore at the bottom
would be about .0065-inch at the middle and .0075-inch at
the top. If much more play than this is evidenced the
piston will &#8220;slap&#8221; in the cylinder and the piston will be
worn at the ends more than in the center. Aluminum or
alloy pistons require more clearance than cast iron ones
do, usually 1.50 times as much. Pistons sometimes warp
out of shape and are not truly cylindrical. This results
in the high spots rubbing on the cylinder while the low<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
spots will be blackened where a certain amount of gas
has leaked by.</p>

<p>Mention has been previously made of the necessity of
reboring or regrinding a cylinder that has become scored
or scratched and which allows the gas to leak by the
piston rings. When the cylinder is ground out, it is necessary
to use a larger piston to conform to the enlarged
cylinder bore. Most manufacturers are prepared to furnish
over-size pistons, there being four standard over-size
dimensions adopted by the S. A. E. for rebored
cylinders. These are .010-inch, .020-inch, .030-inch, and
.040-inch larger than the original bore.</p>

<p>The piston rings should be taken out of the piston
grooves and all carbon deposits removed from the inside
of the ring and the bottom of the groove. It is important
to take this deposit out because it prevents the rings
from performing their proper functions by reducing the
ring elasticity, and if the deposit is allowed to accumulate
it may eventually result in sticking and binding of the
ring, this producing excessive friction or loss of compression.
When the rings are removed they should be tested
to see if they retain their elasticity and it is also well to
see that the small pins in some pistons which keep the
rings from turning around so the joints will not come in
line are still in place. If no pins are found there is no
cause for alarm because these dowels are not always
used. When fitted, they are utilized with rings having a
butt joint or diagonal cut as the superior gas retaining
qualities of the lap or step joint render the pins unnecessary.</p>

<p>If gas has been blowing by the ring or if these members
have not been fitting the cylinder properly the points
where the gas passed will be evidenced by burnt, brown
or roughened portions of the polished surface of the
pistons and rings. The point where this discoloration
will be noticed more often is at the thin end of an eccentric
ring, the discoloration being present for about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>-inch
or <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>-inch each side of the slot. It may be possible
that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
the rings were not true when first put in. This made it
possible for the gas to leak by in small amounts initially
which increased due to continued pressure until quite a
large area for gas escape had been created.</p>

<h3><a name="SecXI_24" id="SecXI_24"></a>PISTON RING MANIPULATION</h3>

<p>Removing piston rings without breaking them is a difficult
operation if the proper means are not taken, but is
a comparatively simple one when the trick is known. The
tools required are very simple, being three strips of thin
steel about one-quarter inch wide and four or five inches
long and a pair of spreading tongs made up of one-quarter
inch diameter keystock tied in the center with a
copper wire to form a hinge. The construction is such
that when the hand is closed and the handles brought together
the other end of the expander spreads out, an
action just opposite to that of the conventional pliers.
The method of using the tongs and the metal strips is
clearly indicated at <a href="#Fig186">Fig. 186</a>. At A the ring expander is
shown spreading the ends of the rings sufficiently to insert
the pieces of sheet metal between one of the rings and the
piston. Grasp the ring as shown at B, pressing with the
thumbs on the top of the piston and the ring will slide off
easily, the thin metal strips acting as guide members to
prevent the ring from catching in the other piston grooves.
Usually no difficulty is experienced in removing the top
or bottom rings, as these members may be easily expanded
and worked off directly without the use of a metal strip.
When removing the intermediate rings, however, the metal
strips will be found very useful. These are usually made
by the repairman by grinding the teeth from old hacksaw
blades and rounding the edges and corners in order to reduce
the liability of cutting the fingers. By the use of the
three metal strips a ring is removed without breaking or
distorting it and practically no time is consumed in the
operation.</p>

Insertion of Rings in Cylinder.</p></div>

<p class='pagenum'><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></p>

<h3><a name="SecXI_25" id="SecXI_25"></a>FITTING PISTON RINGS</h3>

<p>Before installing new rings, they should be carefully
fitted to the grooves to which they are applied. The tools
required are a large piece of fine emery cloth, a thin, flat
file, a small vise with copper or leaden jaw clips, and a
smooth hard surface such as that afforded by the top of
a surface plate or a well planed piece of hard wood. After
making sure that all deposits of burnt oil and carbon have
been removed from the piston grooves, three rings are
selected, one for each groove. The ring is turned all
around its circumference into the groove it is to fit, which
can be done without springing it over the piston as the
outside edge of the ring may be used to test the width of
the groove just as well as the inside edge. The ring should
be a fair fit and while free to move circumferentially there
should be no appreciable up and down motion. If the
ring is a tight fit it should be laid edge down upon the
piece of emery cloth which is placed on the surface plate
and carefully rubbed down until it fits the groove it is to
occupy. It is advisable to fit each piston ring individually
and to mark them in some way to insure that they will be
placed in the groove to which they are fitted.</p>

<p>The repairman next turns his attention to fitting the
ring in the cylinder itself. The ring should be pushed
into the cylinder at least two inches up from the bottom
and endeavor should be made to have the lower edge of
the ring parallel with the bottom of the cylinder. If the
ring is not of correct diameter, but is slightly larger than
the cylinder bore, this condition will be evident by the
angular slots of the rings being out of line or by difficulty
in inserting the ring if it is a lap joint form. If such is
the case the ring is removed from the cylinder and placed
in the vise between soft metal jaw clips. Sufficient metal
is removed with a fine file from the edges of the ring at
the slot until the edges come into line and a slight space
exists between them when the ring is placed into the cylinder.
It is important that this space be left between the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
ends, for if this is not done when the ring becomes heated
the expansion of metal may cause the ends to abut and
the ring to jam in the cylinder.</p>

<p>It is necessary to use more than ordinary caution in
replacing the rings on the piston because they are usually
made of cast iron, a metal that is very fragile and liable
to break because of its brittleness. Special care should
be taken in replacing new rings as these members are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
more apt to break than old ones. This is probably accounted
for by the heating action on used rings which
tends to anneal the metal as well as making it less springy.
The bottom ring should be placed in position first which
is easily accomplished by springing the ring open enough
to pass on the piston and then sliding it into place in the
lower groove which on some types of engines is below
the wrist pin, whereas in others all grooves are above that
member. The other members are put in by a reversal of
the process outlined at <a href="#Fig186">Fig. 186</a>, A and B. It is not always
necessary to use the guiding strips of metal when replacing
rings as it is often possible, by putting the rings on
the piston a little askew and maneuvering them to pass
the grooves without springing the ring into them. The
top ring should be the last one placed in position.</p>

<p>Before placing pistons in the cylinder one should make
sure that the slots in the piston rings are spaced equidistant
on the piston, and if pins are used to keep the ring
from turning one should be careful to make sure that these
pins fit into their holes in the ring and that they are not
under the ring at any point. Practically all cylinders are
chamfered at the lower end to make insertion of piston
rings easier. The operation of putting on a cylinder casting
over a piston really requires two pairs of hands, one
to manipulate the cylinder, the other person to close the
rings as they enter the cylinder. This may be done very
easily by a simple clamp member made of sheet brass or
iron and used to close the ring as indicated at <a href="#Fig186">Fig. 186</a>, C.
It is apparent that the clamp must be adjusted to each
individual ring and that the split portion of the clamp
must coincide with the split portion of the ring. The
cylinder should be well oiled before any attempt is made to
install the pistons. The engine should be run with more
than the ordinary amount of lubricant for several hours
after new piston rings have been inserted. On first starting
the engine, one may be disappointed in that the compression
is even less than that obtained with the old rings.
This condition will soon be remedied as the rings become<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
polished and adapt themselves to the contour of the
cylinder.</p>

<h3><a name="SecXI_26" id="SecXI_26"></a>WRIST PIN WEAR</h3>

<p>While wrist pins are usually made of very tough steel,
case hardened with the object of wearing out an easily
renewable bronze bushing in the upper end of the connecting
rod rather than the wrist pin it sometimes happens
that these members will be worn so that even the replacement
of a new bushing in the connecting rod will
not reduce the lost motion and attendant noise due to a
loose wrist pin. The only remedy is to fit new wrist pins
to the piston. Where the connecting rod is clamped to
the wrist pin and that member oscillates in the piston
bosses the wear will usually be indicated on bronze bushings
which are pressed into the piston bosses. These are
easily renewed and after running a reamer through them
of the proper size no difficulty should be experienced in
replacing either the old or a new wrist pin depending
upon the condition of that member. If no bushings are
provided, as in alloy pistons, the bosses can sometimes
be bored out and thin bushings inserted, though this is
not always possible. The alternative is to ream out the
bosses and upper end of rod a trifle larger after holes are
trued up and fit oversize wrist pins.</p>

<h3><a name="SecXI_27" id="SecXI_27"></a>INSPECTION AND REFITTING OF ENGINE BEARINGS</h3>

<p>While the engine is dismantled one has an excellent
opportunity to examine the various bearing points in the
engine crank-case to ascertain if any looseness exists due
to depreciation of the bearing surfaces. As will be evident,
both main crank-shaft bearings and the lower end
of the connecting rods may be easily examined for deterioration.
With the rods in place, it is not difficult to
feel the amount of lost motion by grasping the connecting
rod firmly with the hand and moving it up and down.
After the connecting rods have been removed and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
propeller hub taken off the crank-shaft to permit of ready
handling, any looseness in the main bearing may be detected
by lifting up on either the front or rear end of
the crank-shaft and observing if there is any lost motion
between the shaft journal and the main bearing caps.
It is not necessary to take an engine entirely apart to
examine the main bearings, as in most forms these may be
readily reached by removing the sump. The symptoms
of worn main bearings are not hard to identify. If an
engine knocks regardless of speed or spark-lever position,
and the trouble is not due to carbon deposits in the combustion
chamber, one may reasonably surmise that the
main bearings have become loose or that lost motion may
exist at the connecting rod big ends, and possibly at the
wrist pins. The main journals of any well resigned engine
are usually proportioned with ample surface and
will not wear unduly unless lubrication has been neglected.
The connecting rod bearings wear quicker than
the main bearings owing to being subjected to a greater
unit stress, and it may be necessary to take these up.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 187.&mdash;Tools and Processes Used in Refitting Engine Bearings.</p></div>

<h3>ADJUSTING MAIN BEARINGS</h3>

<p>When the bearings are not worn enough to require
refitting the lost motion can often be eliminated by removing
one or more of the thin shims or liners ordinarily
used to separate the bearing caps from the seat. These
are shown at <a href="#Fig187">Fig. 187</a>, A. Care must be taken that an
even number of shims of the same thickness are removed
from each side of the journal. If there is considerable
lost motion after one or two shims have been removed,
it will be advisable to take out more shims and to scrape
the bearing to a fit before the bearing cap is tightened
up. It may be necessary to clean up the crank-shaft
journals as these may be scored due to not having received
clean oil or having had bearings seize upon them.
It is not difficult to true up the crank-pins or main journals
if the score marks are not deep. A fine file and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
emery cloth may be used, or a lapping tool such as depicted
at <a href="#Fig187">Fig. 187</a>, B. The latter is preferable because
the file and emery cloth will only tend to smooth the surface
while the lap will have the effect of restoring the
crank to proper contour.</p>

<p>A lapping tool may be easily made, as shown at B, the
blocks being of lead or hard wood. As the width of these
are about half that of the crank-pin the tool may be
worked from side to side as it is rotated. An abrasive
paste composed of fine emery powder and oil is placed
between the blocks, and the blocks are firmly clamped to
the crank-pin. As the lead blocks bed down, the wing
nut should be tightened to insure that the abrasive will be
held with some degree of pressure against the shaft. A
liberal supply of new abrading material is placed between
the lapping blocks and crank-shaft from time to time and
the old mixture cleaned off with gasoline. It is necessary
to maintain a side to side movement of the lapping tool
in order to have the process affect the whole width of the
crank-pin equally. The lapping is continued until a
smooth surface is obtained. If a crank-pin is worn out
of true to any extent the only method of restoring it is
to have it ground down to proper circular form by a
competent mechanic having the necessary machine tools
to carry on the work accurately. A crank-pin truing
tool that may be worked by hand is shown at <a href="#Fig187">Fig. 187</a>, K.</p>

<p>After the crank-shaft is trued the next operation is to
fit it to the main bearings or rather to scrape these members
to fit the shaft journal. In order to bring the brasses
closer together, it may be necessary to remove a little
metal from the edges of the caps to compensate for the
lost motion. A very simple way of doing this is shown
at <a href="#Fig187">Fig. 187</a>, D. A piece of medium emery cloth is rested
on the surface plate and the box or brass is pushed back
and forth over that member by hand, the amount of pressure
and rapidity of movement being determined by the
amount of metal it is necessary to remove. This is better
than filing, because the edges will be flat and there will be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
no tendency for the bearing caps to rock when placed
against the bearing seat. It is important to take enough
off the edges of the boxes to insure that they will grip
the crank tightly. The outer diameter must be checked
with a pair of calipers during this operation to make sure
that the surfaces remain parallel. Otherwise, the bearing
brasses will only grip at one end and with such insufficient
support they will quickly work loose, both in the
bearing seat and bearing cap.</p>

<h3><a name="SecXI_28" id="SecXI_28"></a>SCRAPING BRASSES TO FIT</h3>

<p>To insure that the bearing brasses will be a good fit
on the trued-up crank-pins or crank-shaft journals, they
must be scraped to fit the various crank-shaft journals.
The process of scraping, while a tedious one, is not difficult,
requiring only patience and some degree of care to
do a good job. The surface of the crank-pin is smeared
with Prussian blue pigment which is spread evenly over
the entire surface. The bearings are then clamped together
in the usual manner with the proper bolts, and the
crank-shaft revolved several times to indicate the high
spots on the bearing cap. At the start of the process of
scraping in, the bearing may seat only at a few points as
shown at <a href="#Fig187">Fig. 187</a>, G. Continued scraping will bring the
bearing surface as indicated at H, which is a considerable
improvement, while the process may be considered
complete when the brass indicates a bearing all over as
at I. The high spots are indicated by blue, as where the
shaft does not bear on the bearing there is no color.
The high spots are removed by means of a scraping tool
of the form shown at <a href="#Fig187">Fig. 187</a>, F, which is easily made
from a worn-out file. These are forged to shape and
ground hollow as indicated in the section, and are kept
properly sharpened by frequent rubbing on an ordinary
oil stone. To scrape properly, the edge of the scraper
must be very keen. The straight and curved half-round
scrapers, shown at M and N, are used for bearings. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
three-cornered scraper, outlined at O, is also used on
curved surfaces, and is of value in rounding off the sharp
corners. The straight or curved half-round type works
well on soft-bearing metals, such as babbitt, or white brass,
but on yellow brass or bronze it cuts very slowly, and as
soon as the edge becomes dull considerable pressure is
needed to remove any metal, this calling for frequent
sharpening.</p>

<p>When correcting errors on flat or curved surfaces by
hand-scraping, it is desirable, of course, to obtain an
evenly spotted bearing with as little scraping as possible.
When the part to be scraped is first applied to the surface-plate,
or to a journal in the case of a bearing, three
or four &#8220;high&#8221; spots may be indicated by the marking
material. The time required to reduce these high spots
and obtain a bearing that is distributed over the entire
surface depends largely upon the way the scraping is
started. If the first bearing marks indicate a decided
rise in the surface, much time can be saved by scraping
larger areas than are covered by the bearing marks; this
is especially true of large shaft and engine bearings, etc.
An experienced workman will not only remove the heavy
marks, but also reduce a larger area; then, when the
bearing is tested again, the marks will generally be distributed
somewhat. If the heavy marks which usually
appear at first are simply removed by light scraping,
these &#8220;point bearings&#8221; are gradually enlarged, but a
much longer time will be required to distribute them.</p>

<p>The number of times the bearing must be applied to
the journal for testing is important, especially when the
box or bearing is large and not easily handled. The time
required to distribute the bearing marks evenly depends
largely upon one&#8217;s judgment in &#8220;reading&#8221; these marks.
In the early stages of the scraping operation, the marks
should be used partly as a guide for showing the high
areas, and instead of merely scraping the marked spot
the surface surrounding it should also be reduced, unless
it is evident that the unevenness is local. The idea should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
be to obtain first a few large but generally distributed
marks; then an evenly and finely spotted surface can be
produced quite easily.</p>

<p>In fitting brasses when these are of the removable
type, two methods may be used. The upper half of the
engine base may be inverted on a suitable bench or stand
and the boxes fitted by placing the crank-shaft in position,
clamping down one bearing cap at a time and fitting each
bearing in succession until they bed equally. From that
time on the bearings should be fitted at the same time
so the shaft will be parallel with the bottom of the cylinders.
Considerable time and handling of the heavy crank-shaft
may be saved if a preliminary fitting of the bearing
brasses is made by clamping them together with a carpenter&#8217;s
wood clamp as shown at <a href="#Fig187">Fig. 187</a>, J, and leaving
the crank-shaft attached to the bench as shown at C.
The brasses are revolved around the crank-shaft journal
and are scraped to fit wherever high spots are indicated
until they begin to seat fairly. When the brasses assume
a finished appearance the final scraping should be carried
on with all bearings in place and revolving the crank-shaft
to determine the area of the seating. When the
brasses are properly fitted they will not only show a full
bearing surface, but the shaft will not turn unduly hard
if revolved with a moderate amount of leverage.</p>

<p>Bearings of white metal or babbitt can be fitted tighter
than those of bronze, and care must be observed in supplying
lubricant as considerably more than the usual
amount is needed until the bearings are run in by several
hours of test block work. Before the scraping process
is started it is well to chisel an oil groove in the bearing
as shown at <a href="#Fig187">Fig. 187</a>, L. Grooves are very helpful in
insuring uniform distribution of oil over the entire width
of bearing and at the same time act as reservoirs to retain
a supply of oil. The tool used is a round-nosed chisel,
the effort being made to cut the grooves of uniform
depth and having smooth sides. Care should be taken
not to cut the grooves too deeply, as this will seriously<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
reduce the strength of the bearing bushing. The shape
of the groove ordinarily provided is clearly shown at
<a href="#Fig187">Fig. 187</a>, G, and it will be observed that the grooves do
not extend clear to the edge of the bearing, but stop about
a quarter of an inch from that point. The hole through
which the oil is supplied to the bearing is usually drilled
in such a way that it will communicate with the groove.</p>

<p>The tool shown at <a href="#Fig187">Fig. 187</a>, K, is of recent development,
and is known as a &#8220;crank-shaft equalizer.&#8221; This
is a hand-operated turning tool, carrying cutters which are
intended to smooth down scored crank-pins without using
a lathe. The feed may be adjusted by suitable screws
and the device may be fitted to crank-pins and shaft-journals
of different diameters by other adjusting screws.
This device is not hard to operate, being merely clamped
around the crank-shaft in the same manner as the lapping
tool previously described, and after it has been properly
adjusted it is turned around by the levers provided for
the purpose, the continuous rotary motion removing the
metal just as a lathe tool would.</p>

<h3><a name="SecXI_29" id="SecXI_29"></a>FITTING CONNECTING RODS</h3>

<p>In the marine type rod, which is the form generally
used in airplane engines, one or two bolts are employed
at each side and the cap must be removed entirely before
the bearing can be taken off of the crank-pin. The tightness
of the brasses around the crank-pin can never be
determined solely by the adjustment of the bolts, as while
it is important that these should be drawn up as tightly
as possible, the bearing should fit the shaft without undue
binding, even if the brasses must be scraped to insure
a proper fit. As is true of the main bearings, the marine
form of connecting rod in some engines has a number of
liners or shims interposed between the top and lower
portions of the rod end, and these may be reduced in
number when necessary to bring the brasses closer together.
The general tendency in airplane engines is to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
eliminate shims in either the main or connecting rod
bearings, and when wear is noticed the boxes or liners are
removed and new ones supplied. The brasses are held
in the connecting rod and cap by brass rivets and are
generally attached in the main bearing by small brass
machine screws. The form of box generally favored is
a brass sand casting rich in copper to secure good heat
conductivity which forms a backing for a thin layer of
white brass, babbitt or similar anti-friction metal.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a name="Fig188" id="Fig188"></a>
<img src="images/illo445.png" alt="Fig. 188" width="600" height="320" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 188.&mdash;Showing Points to Observe When Fitting Connecting Rod
Brasses.</p></div>

<p>In fitting new brasses there are two conditions to be
avoided, these being outlined at <a href="#Fig188">Fig. 188</a>, B and C. In
the case shown at C the light edges of the bushings are
in contact, but the connecting rod and its cap do not meet.
When the retaining nuts are tightened the entire strain
is taken on the comparatively small area of the edges of
the bushings which are not strong enough to withstand
the strains existing and which flatten out quickly, permitting
the bearing to run loose. In the example outlined
at B the edges of the brasses do not touch when
the connecting rod cap is drawn in place. This is not
good practice, because the brasses soon become loose in
their retaining member. In the case outlined it is necessary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
to file off the faces of the rod and cap until these
meet, and to insure contact of the edges of the brasses
as well. In event of the brasses coming together before
the cap and rod make contact, as shown at C, the bearing
halves should be reduced at the edges until both the caps
and brasses meet against each other or the surfaces of
the liners as shown at A.</p>

<h3>SPRUNG CAM-SHAFT</h3>

<p>If the cam-shaft is sprung or twisted it will alter the
valve timing to such an extent that the smoothness of
operation of the engine will be materially affected. If
this condition is suspected the cam-shaft may be swung
on lathe centers and turned to see if it runs out and can
be straightened in any of the usual form of shaft-straightening
machines. The shaft may be twisted without being
sprung. This can only be determined by supporting one
end of the shaft in an index head and the other end on
a milling machine center. The cams are then checked to
see that they are separated by the proper degree of angularity.
This process is one that requires a thorough
knowledge of the valve timing of the engine in question,
and is best done at the factory where the engine was
made. The timing gears should also be examined to see
if the teeth are worn enough so that considerable back
lash or lost motion exists between them. This is especially
important where worm or spiral gears are used.
A worn timing gear not only produces noise, but it will
cause the time of opening and closing of the engine valves
to vary materially.</p>

<h3><a name="SecXI_32" id="SecXI_32"></a>PRECAUTIONS IN REASSEMBLING PARTS</h3>

<p>When all of the essential components of a power plant
have been carefully looked over and cleaned and all defects
eliminated, either by adjustment or replacement of
worn portions, the motor should be reassembled, taking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
care to have the parts occupy just the same relative positions
they did before the motor was dismantled. As each
part is added to the assemblage care should be taken to
insure adequate lubrication of all new points of bearing
by squirting liberal quantities of cylinder oil upon them
with a hand oil can or syringe provided for the purpose.
In adjusting the crank-shaft bearings, tighten them one
at a time and revolve the shafts each time one of the
bearing caps is set up to insure that the newly adjusted
bearing does not have undue friction. All retaining keys
and pins must be positively placed and it is good practice
to cover such a part with lubricant before replacing it
because it will not only drive in easier, but the part may
be removed more easily if necessary at some future time.
If not oiled, rust collects around it.</p>

<p>When a piece is held by more than one bolt or screw,
especially if it is a casting of brittle material such as
cast iron or aluminum, the fastening bolts should be tightened
uniformly. If one bolt is tightened more than the
rest it is liable to spring the casting enough to break it.
Spring washers, check nuts, split pins or other locking
means should always be provided, especially on parts
which are in motion or subjected to heavy loads.</p>

<p>Before placing the cylinder over the piston it is imperative
that the slots in the piston rings are spaced
equidistant and that the piston is copiously oiled before
the cylinder is slipped over it. When reassembling the
inlet and exhaust manifolds it is well to use only perfect
packings or gaskets and to avoid the use of those that
seem to have hardened up or flattened out too much in
service. If it is necessary to use new gaskets it is imperative
to employ these at all joints on a manifold, because
if old and new gaskets are used together the new
ones are apt to keep the manifold from bedding properly
upon the used ones. It is well to coat the threads of all
bolts and screws subjected to heat, such as cylinder head
and exhaust manifold retaining bolts, with a mixture of
graphite and oil. Those that enter the water jacket should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
be covered with white or red lead or pipe thread compound.
Gaskets will hold better if coated with shellac
before the manifold or other parts are placed over them.
The shellac fills any irregularities in the joint and assists
materially in preventing leakage after the joint is made
up and the coating has a chance to set.</p>

<p>Before assembling on the shaft, it is necessary to fit
the bearings by scraping, the same instructions given for
restoring the contour of the main bearings applying just
as well in this case. It is apparent that if the crank-pins
are not round no amount of scraping will insure a true
bearing. A point to observe is to make sure that the
heads of the bolts are imbedded solidly in their proper
position, and that they are not raised by any burrs or
particles of dirt under the head which will flatten out
after the engine has been run for a time and allow the
bolts to slack off. Similarly, care should be taken that
there is no foreign matter under the brasses and the
box in which they seat. To guard against this the bolts
should be struck with a hammer several times after they
are tightened up, and the connecting rod can be hit
sharply several times under the cap with a wooden mallet
or lead hammer. It is important to pin the brasses in
place to prevent movement, as lubrication may be interfered
with if the bushing turns round and breaks the correct
register between the oil hole in the cap and brasses.</p>

<p>Care should be taken in screwing on the retaining nuts
to insure that they will remain in place and not slack off.
Spring washers should not be used on either connecting
rod ends or main bearing nuts, because these sometimes
snap in two pieces and leave the nut slack. The best
method of locking is to use well-fitting split pins and
castellated nuts.</p>

<h3><a name="SecXI_30" id="SecXI_30"></a>TESTING BEARING PARALLELISM</h3>

<p>It is not possible to give other than general directions
regarding the proper degree of tightening for a connecting
rod bearing, but as a guide to correct adjustment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
it may be said that if the connecting rod cap is tightened
sufficiently so the connecting rod will just about fall over
from a vertical position due to the piston weight when
the bolts are fully tightened up, the adjustment will be
nearly correct. As previously stated, babbitt or white
metal bearings can be set up more tightly than bronze,
as the metal is softer and any high spots will soon be
leveled down with the running of the engine. It is important
that care be taken to preserve parallelism of
the wrist-pins and crank-shafts while scraping in bearings.
This can be determined in two ways. That shown
at <a href="#Fig189">Fig. 189</a>, A, is used when the parts are not in the
engine assembly and when the connecting rod bearing is
being fitted to a mandrel or arbor the same size as the
crank-pin. The arbor, which is finished very smooth and
of uniform diameter, is placed in two V blocks, which in
turn are supported by a level surface plate. An adjustable
height gauge may be tried, first at one side of
the wrist-pin which is placed at the upper end of the
connecting rod, then at the other, and any variation will
be easily determined by the degree of tilting of the rod.
This test may be made with the wrist-pin alone, or if
the piston is in place, a straight edge or spirit level may
be employed. The spirit level will readily show any inclination
while the straight edge is used in connection
with the height gauge as indicated. Of course, the surface
plate must be absolutely level when tests are made.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="Fig189" id="Fig189"></a>
<img src="images/illo450.png" alt="Fig. 189" width="400" height="450" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 189.&mdash;Methods of Testing to Insure Parallelism of Bearings After
Fitting.</p></div>

<p>When the connecting rods are being fitted with the
crank-shaft in place in crank-case, and that member secured
in the frame, a steel square may be used as it is
reasonable to assume that the wrist-pin, and consequently
the piston it carries, should observe a true relation with
the top of the engine base. If the piston side is at right
angles with the top of the engine base it is reasonable
to assume that the wrist-pin and crank-pin are parallel.
If the piston is canted to one side or the other, it will
indicate that the brasses have been scraped tapering,
which would mean considerable heating and undue friction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
if the piston is installed in the cylinder on account
of the pressure against one portion of the cylinder wall.
If the degree of canting is not too great, the connecting
rods may be sprung very slightly to straighten up the
piston, but this is a makeshift that is not advised. The
height gauge method shown above may be used instead
of the steel square, if desired, because the top of the
crank-case is planed or milled true and should be parallel
with the center line of the crank-shaft.</p>

<p class='pagenum'><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></p>

<h3><a name="SecXI_31" id="SecXI_31"></a>CAM-SHAFTS AND TIMING GEARS</h3>

<p>Knocking sounds are also evident if the cam-shaft is
loose in its bearings, and also if the cams or timing
gears are loose on the shaft. The cam-shaft is usually
supported by solid bearings of the removable bushing
type, having no compensation for depreciation. If these
bearings wear the only remedy is replacement with new
ones. In the older makes of cars it was general practice
to machine the cams separately and to secure these to the
cam-shaft by means of taper pins or keys. These members
sometimes loosened and caused noise. In the event
of the cams being loose, care should be taken to use new
keys or taper pins, as the case may be. If the fastening
used was a pin, the hole through the cam-shaft will
invariably be slightly oval from wear. In order to insure
a tight job, the holes in cam and shaft must be reamed
with the next larger size of standard taper reamer and
a larger pin driven in. Another point to watch is the
method of retaining the cam-shaft gear in place. On
some engines the gear is fastened to a flange on the
cam-shaft by retaining screws. These are not apt to
become loose, but where reliance is placed on a key the
cam-shaft gear may often be loose on its supporting
member. The only remedy is to enlarge the key slot
in both gear and shaft and to fit a larger retaining key.</p>

<h3><a name="SecXII_1" id="SecXII_1"></a>AVIATION ENGINE TYPES</h3>

<p>Inasmuch as numerous forms of airplane engines have
been devised, it would require a volume of considerable
size to describe even the most important developments
of recent years. As considerable explanatory matter has
been given in preceding chapters and the principles involved
in internal combustion engine operation considered
in detail, a relatively brief review of the features
of some of the most successful airplane motors should
suffice to give the reader a complete enough understanding
of the art so all types of engines can be readily
recognized and the advantages and disadvantages of each
type understood, as well as defining the constructional
features enough so the methods of locating and repairing
the common engine and auxiliary system troubles
will be fully grasped.</p>

<p><a name="SecXII_2" id="SecXII_2"></a>Aviation engines can be divided into three main
classes. One of the earliest attempts to devise distinctive
power plant designs for aircraft involved the construction
of engines utilizing a radial arrangement of the
cylinders or a star-wise disposition. Among the engines
of this class may be mentioned the Anzani, R. E. P. and
the Salmson or Canton and Unn&eacute; forms. The two former
are air-cooled, the latter design is water-cooled. Engines<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
of this type have been built in cylinder numbers ranging
from three to twenty. While the simple forms were
popular in the early days of aviation engine development,
they have been succeeded by the more conventional
arrangements which now form the largest class. The
reason for the adoption of a star-wise arrangement of
cylinders has been previously considered. Smoothness
of running can only be obtained by using a considerable
number of cylinders. The fundamental reason for the
adoption of the star-wise disposition is that a better distribution
of stress is obtained by having all of the pistons
acting on the same crank-pin so that the crank-throw and
pin are continuously under maximum stress. Some difficulty
has been experienced in lubricating the lower cylinders
in some forms of six cylinder, rotary crank, radial
engines but these have been largely overcome so they are
not as serious in practice as a theoretical consideration
would indicate.</p>

<p>Another class of engines developed to meet aviation
requirements is a complete departure from the preceding
class, though when the engines are at rest, it is difficult
to differentiate between them. This class includes engines
having a star-wise disposition of the cylinders but
the cylinders themselves and the crank-case rotate and
the crank-shaft remains stationary. The important rotary
engines are the Gnome, the Le Rhone and the Clerget.
By far the most important classification is that including
engines which retain the approved design of the
types of power plants that have been so widely utilized
in automobiles and which have but slight modifications
to increase reliability and mechanical strength and produce
a reduction in weight. This class includes the
vertical engines such as the Duesenberg and Hall-Scott
four-cylinder; the Wisconsin, Aeromarine, Mercedes,
Benz, and Hall-Scott six-cylinder vertical engines and
the numerous eight- and twelve-cylinder Vee designs such
as the Curtiss, Renault, Thomas-Morse, Sturtevant, Sunbeam,
and others.</p>

<p class='pagenum'><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></p>

<h3><a name="SecXII_3" id="SecXII_3"></a>ANZANI ENGINES</h3>

<p>The attention of the mechanical world was first directed
to the great possibilities of mechanical flight when
Bleriot crossed the English Channel in July, 1909, in a
monoplane of his own design and construction, having
the power furnished by a small three-cylinder air-cooled
engine rated at about 24 horse-power and having cylinders
4.13 inches bore and 5.12 inches stroke, stated to
develop the power at about 1600 R.P.M. and weighing 145
pounds. The arrangement of this early Anzani engine is
shown at <a href="#Fig190">Fig. 190</a>, and it will be apparent that in the
main, the lines worked out in motorcycle practice were
followed to a large extent. The crank-case was of the
usual vertically divided pattern, the cylinders and heads
being cast in one piece and held to the crank-case by
stud bolts passing through substantial flanges at the
cylinder base. In order to utilize but a single crank-pin
for the three cylinders it was necessary to use two forked
rods and one rod of the conventional type. The arrangement
shown at <a href="#Fig190">Fig. 190</a>, called for the use of counter-balanced
flywheels which were built up in connection
with shafts and a crank-pin to form what corresponds to
the usual crank-shaft assembly.</p>

<p>The inlet valves were of the automatic type so that a
very simple valve mechanism consisting only of the exhaust
valve push rods was provided. One of the difficulties
of this arrangement of cylinders was that the
impulses are not evenly spaced. For instance, in the
forms where the cylinders were placed 60 degrees apart
the space between the firing of the first cylinder and that
next in order was 120 degrees crank-shaft rotation, after
which there was an interval of 300 degrees before the
last cylinder to fire delivered its power stroke. In order
to increase the power given by the simple three-cylinder
air-cooled engine a six-cylinder water-cooled type, as
shown at <a href="#Fig191">Figs. 191</a> and <a href="#Fig192">192</a>, was devised. This was practically
the same in action as the three-cylinder except<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
that a double throw crank-shaft was used and while the
explosions were not evenly spaced the number of explosions
obtained resulted in fairly uniform application of
power.</p>

<p>The latest design of three-cylinder Anzani engine,
which is used to some extent for school machines, is
shown at <a href="#Fig193">Fig. 193</a>. In this, the three-cylinders are symmetrically
arranged about the crank-case or 120 degrees
apart. The balance is greatly improved by this arrangement
and the power strokes occur at equal intervals of
240 degrees of crank-shaft rotation. This method of construction
is known as the Y design. By grouping two of
these engines together, as outlined at <a href="#Fig194">Fig. 194</a>, which
gives an internal view, and at <a href="#Fig195">Fig. 195</a>, which shows the
sectional view, and using the ordinary form of double
throw crank-shaft with crank-pins separated by 180 degrees,
a six-cylinder radial engine is produced which runs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
very quietly and furnishes a steady output of power.
The peculiarity of the construction of this engine is in
the method of grouping the connecting rod about the
common crank-pin without using forked rods or the
&#8220;Mother rod&#8221; system employed in the Gnome engines.
In the Anzani the method followed is to provide each
connecting rod big end with a shoe which consists of a
portion of a hollow cylinder held against the crank-pin
by split clamping rings. The dimensions of these shoes
are so proportioned that the two adjacent connecting rods
of a group of three will not come into contact even when
the connecting rods are at the minimum relative angle.
The three shoes of each group rest upon a bronze sleeve
which is in halves and which surrounds the crank-pin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
and rotates relatively to it once in each crank-shaft revolution.
The collars, which are of tough bronze, resist the
inertia forces while the direct pressure of the explosions
is transmitted directly to the crank-pin bushing by the
shoes at the big end of the connecting rod. The same
method of construction, modified to some extent, is used
in the Le Rhone rotary cylinder engine.</p>

<p>Both cylinders and pistons of the Anzani engines are
of cast iron, the cylinders being provided with a liberal
number of cooling flanges which are cast integrally. A
series of auxiliary exhaust ports is drilled near the base<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
of each cylinder so that a portion of the exhaust gases
will flow out of the cylinder when the piston reaches the
end of its power stroke. This reduces the temperature
of the gases passing around the exhaust valves and prevents
warping of these members. Another distinctive
feature of this engine design is the method of attaching
the Zenith carburetor to an annular chamber surrounding
the rear portion of the crank-case from which the intake
pipes leading to the intake valves radiate. The magneto<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
is the usual six-cylinder form having the armature geared
to revolve at one and one-half times crank-shaft speed.</p>

will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
be apparent that in the ten-cylinder form explosions will
occur every 72 degrees of crank-shaft rotation, while in
the twenty-cylinder, 200 horse-power engine at any instant
five of the cylinders are always working and explosions
are occurring every 36 degrees of crank-shaft
rotation. On the twenty-cylinder engine, two carburetors<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
are used and two magnetos, which are driven at two and
one-half times crank-shaft speed. The general cylinder
and valve construction is practically the same, as in the
simpler engines.</p>

<h3><a name="SecXII_4" id="SecXII_4"></a>CANTON AND UNN&Eacute; ENGINE</h3>

<p>This engine, which has been devised specially for
aviation service, is generally known as the &#8220;Salmson&#8221;
and is manufactured in both France and Great Britain.
It is a nine-cylinder water-cooled radial engine, the nine
cylinders being symmetrically disposed around the crank-shaft
while the nine connecting rods all operate on a
common crank-pin in somewhat the same manner as the
rods in the Gnome motor. The crank-shaft of the Salmson
engine is not a fixed one and inasmuch as the cylinders
do not rotate about the crank-shaft it is necessary
for that member to revolve as in the conventional engine.
The stout hollow steel crank-shaft is in two pieces and
has a single throw. The crank-shaft is built up somewhat
the same as that of the Gnome engine. Ball bearings
are used throughout this engine as will be evident
by inspecting the sectional view given at <a href="#Fig199">Fig. 199</a>. The
nine steel connecting rods are machined all over and are
fitted at each end with bronze bushings, the distance
between the bearing centers being about 3.25 times crank
length. The method of connecting up the rods to the
crank-pin is one of the characteristic features of this
design. No &#8220;mother&#8221; rod as supplied in the Gnome
engine is used in this type inasmuch as the steel cage or
connecting rod carrier is fitted with symmetrically disposed
big end retaining pins. Inasmuch as the carrier
is mounted on ball bearings some means must be provided
of regulating the motion of the carrier as if no
means were provided the resulting motion of the pistons
would be irregular.</p>

<p>The method by which the piston strokes are made to
occur at precise intervals involves a somewhat lengthy
and detailed technical explanation. It is sufficient to say<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
that an epicyclic train of gears, one of which is rigidly
attached to the crank-case so it cannot rotate is used,
while other gears make a connection between the fixed
gear and with another gear which is exactly the same
size as the fixed gear attached to the crank-case and which
is formed integrally with the connecting rod carrier. The
action of the gearing is such that the cage carrying the
big end retaining pins does not rotate independently of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
the crank-shaft, though, of course, the crank-shaft or
rather crank-pin bearings must turn inside of the big
end carrier cage.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="Fig199" id="Fig199"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 199.&mdash;Sectional View Showing Construction of Canton and Unn&eacute;
Water-Cooled Radial Cylinder Engine.</p></div>

<p>Cylinders of this engine are of nickel steel machined
all over and carry water-jackets of spun copper which
are attached to the cylinders by brazing. The water
jackets are corrugated to permit the cylinder to expand
freely. The ignition is similar to that of the fixed crank
rotating cylinder engine. An ordinary magneto of the
two spark type driven at 1<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> times crank-shaft speed is
sufficient to ignite the seven-cylinder form, while in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
nine-cylinder engines the ignition magneto is of the
&#8220;shield&#8221; type giving four sparks per revolution. The
magneto is driven at 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>9</sub> times crank-shaft speed. Nickel
steel valves are used and are carried in castings or cages
which screw into bosses in the cylinder head. Each
valve is cam operated through a tappet, push rod and
rocker arm, seven cams being used on a seven-cylinder
engine and nine cams on the nine-cylinder. One cam
serves to open both valves as in its rotation it lifts the
tappets in succession and so operates the exhaust and
inlet valves respectively. This method of operation involves
the same period of intake and exhaust. In normal
engine practice the inlet valve opens 12 degrees
late and closes 20 degrees late. The exhaust opens
45 degrees early and closes 6 degrees late. This means
about 188 degrees in the case of inlet valve and 231 degrees
crank-shaft travel for exhaust valves. In the
Salmson engine, the exhaust closes and the inlet opens at
the outer dead center and the exhaust opens and the inlet
closes at about the inner dead center. This engine is
also made in a fourteen-cylinder 200 B.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;P. design
which is composed of two groups of seven-cylinders, and
it has been made in an eighteen-cylinder design of 600
horse-power. The nine-cylinder 130 horse-power has a
cylinder bore of 4.73 inches and a stroke of 5.52 inches.
Its normal speed of rotation is 1250 R.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;M. Owing to
the radial arrangement of the cylinders, the weight is but
4<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> pounds per B.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;P.</p>

<h3><a name="SecXII_5" id="SecXII_5"></a>CONSTRUCTION OF EARLY GNOME MOTOR</h3>

<p>It cannot be denied that for a time one of the most
widely used of aeroplane motors was the seven-cylinder
revolving air-cooled Gnome, made in France. For a total
weight of 167 pounds this motor developed 45 to 47 horsepower
at 1,000 revolutions, being equal to 3.35 pounds
per horse-power, and has proved its reliability by securing
many long-distance and endurance records. The same<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473"></a></span>
engineers have produced a nine-cylinder and by combining
two single engines a fourteen-cylinder revolving
Gnome, having a nominal rating of 100 horse-power, with
which world&#8217;s speed records were broken. A still more
powerful engine has been made with eighteen-cylinders.
The nine-cylinder &#8220;monosoupape&#8221; delivers 100 horse-power
at 1200 R.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;M., the engine of double that number
of cylinders is rated at about 180 horse-power.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 200.&mdash;Sectional View Outlining Construction of Early Type Gnome Valve-in-Piston Type Motor.</p></div>

<p>Except in the number of cylinders and a few mechanical
details the fourteen-cylinder motor is identical with
the seven-cylinder one; fully three-quarters of the parts
used by the assemblers would do just as well for one
motor as for the other. Owing to the greater power demands
of the modern airplane the smaller sizes of Gnome
engines are not used as much as they were except for
school machines. There is very little in this motor that
is common to the standard type of vertical motorcar
engine. The cylinders are mounted radially round a circular
crank-case; the crank-shaft is fixed, and the entire
mass of cylinders and crank-case revolves around it as
outlined at <a href="#Fig200">Fig. 200</a>. The explosive mixture and the
lubricating oil are admitted through the fixed hollow
crank-shaft, passed into the explosion chamber through
an automatic intake valve in the piston head in the early
pattern, and the spent gases exhausted through a mechanically
operated valve in the cylinder head. The
course of the gases is practically a radial one. A peculiarity
of the construction of the motor is that nickel steel
is used throughout. Aluminum is employed for the two
oil pump housings; the single compression ring known
as the &#8220;obdurator&#8221; for each piston is made of brass;
there are three or four brass bushes; gun metal is employed
for certain pins&mdash;the rest is machined out of
chrome nickel steel. The crank-case is practically a steel
hoop, the depth depending on whether it has to receive
seven-or fourteen-cylinders; it has seven or fourteen
holes bored as illustrated on its circumference. When
fourteen or eighteen cylinders are used the holes are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
bored in two distinct planes, and offset in relation one to
the other.</p>

<p>The cylinders of the small engine which have a bore
of 4<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub> inches and a stroke of 4<sup>7</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub> inches, are machined
out of the solid bar of steel until the thickness of the walls
is only 1.5 millimeters&mdash;.05905 inch, or practically <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub> inch.
Each one has twenty-two fins which gradually taper down
as the region of greatest pressure is departed from. In
addition to carrying away heat, the fins assist in strengthening
the walls of the cylinder. The barrel of the cylinder
is slipped into the hole bored for it on the circumference
of the crank-case and secured by a locking member
in the nature of a stout compression ring, sprung onto a
groove on the base of the cylinder within the crank chamber.
On each lateral face of the crank chamber are seven
holes, drilled right through the chamber parallel with the
crank-shaft. Each one of these holes receives a stout
locking-pin of such a diameter that it presses against
the split rings of two adjacent cylinders; in addition
each cylinder is fitted with a key-way. This construction
is not always followed, some of the early Gnome engines
using the same system of cylinder retention as used on
the latest &#8220;monosoupape&#8221; pattern.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 201.&mdash;Sectional View of Early Type Gnome Cylinder and Piston
Showing Construction and Application of Inlet and Exhaust Valves.</p></div>

<p>The exhaust valve is mounted in the cylinder head,
<a href="#Fig201">Fig. 201</a>, its seating being screwed in by means of a
special box spanner. On the fourteen-cylinder model the
valve is operated directly by an overhead rocker arm
with a gun metal rocker at its extremity coming in contact
with the extremity of the valve stem. As in standard
motor car practice, the valve is opened under the lift of
the vertical push rod, actuated by the cam. The distinctive
feature is the use of a four-blade leaf spring with
a forked end encircling the valve stems and pressing
against a collar on its extremity. On the seven-cylinder
model the movement is reversed, the valve being opened
on the downward pull of the push rod, this lifting the
outer extremity of the main rocker arm, which tips a
secondary and smaller rocker arm in direct contact with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
the extremity of the valve stem. The springs are the
same in each case. The two types are compared at A
and B, <a href="#Fig202">Fig. 202</a>.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 202.&mdash;Details of Old Style Gnome Motor Inlet and Exhaust Valve Construction and Operation.</p></div>

<p>The pistons, like the cylinders, are machined out of
the solid bar of nickel steel, and have a portion of their
wall cut away, so that the two adjacent ones will not
come together at the extremity of their stroke. The head<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
of the piston is slightly reduced in diameter and is provided
with a groove into which is fitted a very light
L-section brass split ring; back of this ring and carried
within the groove is sprung a light steel compression
ring, serving to keep the brass ring in expansion. As
already mentioned, the intake valves are automatic, and
are mounted in the head of the piston as outlined at <a href="#Fig202">Fig.
202</a>, C. The valve seating is in halves, the lower portion
being made to receive the wrist-pin and connecting rod,
and the upper portion, carrying the valve, being screwed
into it. The spring is composed of four flat blades, with
the hollowed stem of the automatic valve passing through
their center and their two extremities attached to small
levers calculated to give balance against centrifugal force.
The springs are naturally within the piston, and are lubricated
by splash from the crank chamber. They are of
a delicate construction, for it is necessary that they shall
be accurately balanced so as to have no tendency to fly
open under the action of centrifugal force. The intake
valve is withdrawn by the use of special tools through the
cylinder head, the exhaust valve being first dismounted.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 203.&mdash;The Gnome Fourteen-Cylinder 100 Horse-Power Aviation Engine.</p></div>

<p>The fourteen-cylinder motor shown at <a href="#Fig203">Fig. 203</a>, has a
two-throw crank-shaft with the throws placed at 180 degrees,
each one receiving seven connecting rods. The
parts are the same as for the seven-cylinder motor, the
larger one consisting of two groups placed side by side.
For each group of seven-cylinders there is one main connecting
rod, together with six auxiliary rods. The main
connecting rod, which, like the others, is of H section, has
machined with it two L-section rings bored with six holes&mdash;51<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>
degrees apart to take the six other connecting
rods. The cage of the main connecting rod carries two
ball races, one on either side, fitting onto the crank-pin
and receiving the thrust of the seven connecting rods.
The auxiliary connecting rods are secured in position in
each case by a hollow steel pin passing through the two
rings. It is evident that there is a slightly greater angularity
for the six shorter rods, known as auxiliary connecting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
rods, than for the longer main rods; this does not
appear to have any influence on the running of the motor.</p>

<p>Coming to the manner in which the earliest design exhaust
valves are operated on the old style motor, this at
first sight appears to be one of the most complicated
parts of the motor, probably because it is one in which
standard practice is most widely departed from. Within
the cylindrical casing bolted to the rear face of the crank-case
are seven, thin flat-faced steel rings, forming female
cams. Across a diameter of each ring is a pair of projecting
rods fitting in brass guides and having their
extremities terminating in a knuckle eye receiving the
adjustable push rods operating the overhead rocker arms
of the exhaust valve. The guides are not all in the same
plane, the difference being equal to the thickness of the
steel rings, the total thickness being practically 2 inches.
Within the female cams is a group of seven male cams
of the same total thickness as the former and rotating
within them. As the boss of the male cam comes into
contact with the flattened portion of the ring forming
the female cam, the arm is pushed outward and the exhaust
valve opened through the medium of the push-rod
and overhead rocker. This construction was afterwards
changed to seven male cams and simple valve operating
plunger and roller cam followers as shown at <a href="#Fig204">Fig. 204</a>.</p>

Revolving Engine.</p></div>

<p>On the face of the crank-case of the fourteen-cylinder
motor opposite to the valve mechanism is a bolted-on end
plate, carrying a pinion for driving the two magnetos
and the two oil pumps, and having bolted to it the distributor
for the high-tension current. Each group of
seven-cylinders has its own magneto and lubricating
pump. The two magnetos and the two pumps are mounted
on the fixed platform carrying the stationary crank-shaft,
being driven by the pinion on the revolving crank chamber.
The magnetos are geared up in the proportion of
4 to 7. Mounted on the end plate back of the driving
pinion are the two high-tension distributor plates, each
one with seven brass segments let into it and connection<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
made to the plugs by means of plain brass wire. The
wire passes through a hole in the plug and is then

It is possible to fire the charges in two ways, firstly, in
rotation, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, thus having six impulses in one
revolution and none in the next; or alternately, 1, 3, 5, 2,
4, 6, in which case the engine will have turned through
an equal number of degrees between impulses 1 and 3,
and 3 and 5, but a greater number between 5 and 2, even
again between 2 and 4, 4 and 6, and a less number between
6 and 1, as will be clearly seen on reference to the
diagram. Turning to <a href="#Fig205">Fig. 205</a>, B, which represents a
seven-cylinder engine. If the cylinders fire alternately
it is obvious that the engine turns through an equal
number of degrees between each impulse, thus, 1, 3, 5, 7,
2, 4, 6, 1, 3, etc. Thus supposing the engine to be revolving,
the explosion takes place as each alternate cylinder
passes, for instance, the point 1 on the diagram, and the
ignition is actually operated in this way by a single
contact.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 206.&mdash;Simple Carburetor Used On Early Gnome Engines Attached
to Fixed Crank-Shaft End.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>The crank-shaft of the Gnome, as already explained,
is fixed and hollow. For the seven- and nine-cylinder
motors it has a single throw, and for the fourteen- and
eighteen-cylinder models has two throws at 180 degrees.
It is of the built-up type, this being necessary on account
of the distinctive mounting of the connecting rods. The
carburetor shown at <a href="#Fig206">Fig. 206</a> is mounted at one end of
the stationary crank-shaft, and the mixture is drawn in
through a valve in the piston as already explained. There
is neither float chamber nor jet. In many of the tests
made at the factory it is said the motor will run with the
extremity of the gasoline pipe pushed into the hollow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
crank-shaft, speed being regulated entirely by increasing
or decreasing the flow through the shut-off valve in the
base of the tank. Even under these conditions the motor
has been throttled down to run at 350 revolutions without
misfiring. Its normal speed is 1,000 to 1,200 revolutions
a minute. Castor oil is used for lubricating the
engine, the oil being injected into the hollow crank-shaft
through slight-feed fittings by a mechanically operated
pump which is clearly shown in sectional diagrams at
<a href="#Fig207">Fig. 207</a>.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 207.&mdash;Sectional Views of the Gnome Oil Pump.</p></div>

<p>The Gnome is a considerable consumer of lubricant,
the makers&#8217; estimate being 7 pints an hour for the 100
horse-power motor; but in practice this is largely exceeded.
The gasoline consumption is given as 300 to 350
grammes per horse-power. The total weight of the fourteen-cylinder
motor is 220 pounds without fuel or lubricating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
oil. Its full power is developed at 1,200 revolutions,
and at this speed about 9 horse-power is lost in
overcoming air resistance to cylinder rotation.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="Fig208" id="Fig208"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 208.&mdash;Simplified Diagram Showing Gnome Motor Magneto Ignition
System.</p></div>

<p>While the Gnome engine has many advantages, on the
other hand, the head resistance offered by a motor of this
type is considerable; there is a large waste of lubricating
oil due to the centrifugal force which tends to throw the
oil away from the cylinders; the gyroscopic effect of
the rotary motor is detrimental to the best working of the
aeroplane, and moreover it requires about seven per cent.
of the total power developed by the motor to drive the
revolving cylinders around the shaft. Of necessity, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
compression of this type of motor is rather low, and an
additional disadvantage manifests itself in the fact that
there is as yet no satisfactory way of muffling the rotary
type of motor.</p>

<h3><a name="SecXII_6" id="SecXII_6"></a>GNOME &#8220;MONOSOUPAPE&#8221; TYPE</h3>

<p>The latest type of Gnome engine is known as the
&#8220;monosoupape&#8221; type because but one valve is used in
the cylinder head, the inlet valve in the piston being dispensed
with on account of the trouble caused by that
member on earlier engines. The construction of this
latest type follows the lines established in the earlier
designs to some extent and it differs only in the method
of charging. The very rich mixture of gas and air is
forced into the crank-case through the jet inside the
crank-shaft, and enters the cylinder when the piston is
at its lowest position, through the half-round openings
in the guiding flange and the small holes or ports machined
in the cylinder and clearly shown at <a href="#Fig210">Fig. 210</a>.
The returning piston covers the port, and the gas is compressed
and fired in the usual way. The exhaust is
through a large single valve in the cylinder head, which
gives rise to the name &#8220;monosoupape,&#8221; or single-valve
motor, and this valve also remains open a portion of the
intake stroke to admit air into the cylinder and dilute
the rich gas forced in from the crank-case interior.
Aviators who have used the early form of Gnome say
that the inlet valve in the piston type was prone to catch
on fire if any valve defect materialized, but the &#8220;monosoupape&#8221;
pattern is said to be nearly free of this danger.
The bore of the 100 horse-power nine-cylinder engine is
110 mm., the piston stroke 150 mm. Extremely careful
machine work and fitting is necessary. In many parts,
tolerances of less than <span class="nowrap">.0004&#8242;&#8242;</span> (four ten thousandths of
an inch) are all that are allowed. This is about one-sixth
the thickness of the average human hair, and in
other parts the size must be absolutely standard, no
appreciable variation being allowable. The manufacture<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
of this engine establishes new mechanical standards of
engine production in this country. Much machine work
is needed in producing the finished components from the
bar and forging.</p>

<p>The cylinders, for example, are machined from 6 inch
solid steel bars, which are sawed into blanks 11 inches
in length and weighing about 97 pounds. The first operation
is to drill a 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub> inch hole through the center of the
block. A heavy-duty drilling machine performs this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
work, then the block goes to the lathe for further operations.
<a href="#Fig211">Fig. 211</a> shows six stages of the progress of a
cylinder, a few of the intermediate steps being omitted.
These give, however, a good idea of the work done. The
turning of the gills, or cooling flanges, is a difficult proposition,
owing to the depth of the cut and the thin metal
that forms the gills. This operation requires the utmost
care of tools and the use of a good lubricant to prevent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
the metal from tearing as the tools approach their full
depth. These gills are only 0.6 mm., or 0.0237 in., thick
at the top, tapering to a thickness of 1.4 mm. (0.0553 in.)
at the base, and are 16 mm. (0.632 in.) deep. When the
machine work is completed the cylinder weighs but 5<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>
pounds.</p>

<h3>GNOME FUEL SYSTEM, IGNITION AND LUBRICATION</h3>

<p>The following description of the fuel supply, ignition
and oiling of the &#8220;monosoupape,&#8221; or single valve Gnome,
is taken from &#8220;The Automobile.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gasoline is fed to the engine by means of air pressure
at 5 pounds per sq. in., which is produced by the air
pump on the engine clearly shown at <a href="#Fig210">Fig. 210</a>. A pressure
gauge convenient to the operator indicates this pressure,
and a valve enables the operator to control it. No
carburetor is used. The gasoline flows from the tank
through a shut-off valve near the operator and through
a tube leading through the hollow crank-shaft to a spray
nozzle located in the crank-case. There is no throttle
valve, and as each cylinder always receives the same
amount of air as long as the atmospheric pressure is the
same, the output cannot be varied by reducing the fuel
supply, except within narrow limits. A fuel capacity of
65 gallons is provided. The fuel consumption is at the
rate of 12 U. S. gallons per hour.</p>

<p>The high-tension magnetos, with double cam or two
break per revolution interrupter, is located on the thrust
plate in an inverted position, and is driven at such a
speed as to produce nine sparks for every two revolutions;
that is, at 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> times engine speed. A Splitdorf
magneto is fitted. There is no distributor on the magneto.
The high-tension collector brush of the magneto
is connected to a distributor brush holder carried in the
bearer plate of the engine. The brush in this brush
holder is pressed against a distributor ring of insulating
material molded in position in the web of a gear wheel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
keyed to the thrust plate, which gear serves also for
starting the engine by hand. Molded in this ring of insulating
material are nine brass contact sectors, connecting
with contact screws at the back side of the gear,
from which bare wires connect to the spark-plugs. The
distributor revolves at engine speed, instead of at half
engine speed as on ordinary engines, and the distributor
brush is brought into electrical connection with each
spark-plug every time the piston in the cylinder in which
this spark-plug is located approaches the outer dead
center. However, on the exhaust stroke no spark is being
generated in the magneto, hence none is produced at the
spark-plug.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="Fig212" id="Fig212"></a>
<img src="images/illo486.jpg" alt="Fig. 212" width="450" height="303" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 212.&mdash;The Gnome Engine Cam-Gear Case, a Fine Example of Accurate
Machine Work.</p></div>

<p>Ordinarily the engine is started by turning on the
propeller, but for emergency purposes as in seaplanes or
for a quick &#8220;get away&#8221; if landing inadvertently in
enemy territory, a hand starting crank is provided. This
is supported in bearings secured to the pressed steel
carriers of the engine and is provided with a universal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
joint between the two supports so as to prevent binding
of the crank in the bearings due to possible distortion
of the supports. The gear on this starting crank and the
one on the thrust plate with which it meshes are cut
with helical teeth of such hand that the starting pinion
is thrown out of mesh as soon as the engine picks up its
cycle. A coiled spring surrounds part of the shaft of the
starting crank and holds it out of gear when not in use.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="Fig213" id="Fig213"></a>
<img src="images/illo487.jpg" alt="Fig. 213" width="450" height="494" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 213.&mdash;G. V. Gnome &#8220;Monosoupape,&#8221; with Cam-Case Cover Removed to

<p>Lubricating oil is carried in a tank of 25 gallon capacity,
and if this tank has to be placed in a low position<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
it is connected with the air-pressure line, so that the
suction of the oil pump is not depended upon to get the
oil to the pump. From the bottom of the oil tank a pipe
leads to the pump inlet. There are two outlets from the
pump, each entering the hollow crank-shaft, and there is
a branch from each outlet pipe to a circulation indicator
convenient to the operator. One of the oil leads feeds
to the housing in the thrust plate containing the two rear
ball bearings, and the other lead feeds through the crank-pin
to the cams, as already explained.</p>

<p>Owing to the effect of centrifugal force and the fact
that the oil is not used over again, the oil consumption
of a revolving cylinder engine is considerably higher than
that of a stationary cylinder engine. Fuel consumption
is also somewhat higher, and for this reason the revolving
cylinder engine is not so well suited for types of airplanes
designed for long trips, as the increased weight
of supplies required for such trips, as compared with
stationary cylinder type motors, more than offsets the
high weight efficiency of the engine itself. But for short
trips, and especially where high speed is required, as in
single seated scout and battle planes or &#8220;avions de
chasse,&#8221; as the French say, the revolving cylinder engine
has the advantage. The oil consumption of the Gnome
engine is as high as 2.4 gallon per hour. Castor oil is
used for lubrication because it is not cut by the gasoline
mist present in the engine interior as an oil of mineral
derivation would be.</p>

<h3><a name="SecXII_7" id="SecXII_7"></a>GERMAN &#8220;GNOME&#8221; TYPE ENGINE</h3>

<p>A German adaptation of the Gnome design is shown
at <a href="#Fig214">Fig. 214</a>. This is known as the Bayerischen Motoren
Gesellschaft engine and the type shown is an early design
rated at 50 horse-power. The bore is 110 mm., the stroke
is 120 mm., and it is designed to run at a speed of 1,200
R.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;M. It is somewhat similar in design to the early
Gnome &#8220;valve-in-piston&#8221; design except that two valves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494"></a></span>are carried in the piston top instead of one. The valve
operating arrangement is different also, as a single four
point cam is used to operate the seven exhaust valves.
It is driven by epicyclic gearing, the cam being driven by
an internal gear machined integrally with it, the cam
being turned at <sup>7</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> times the engine speed. Another
feature is the method of holding the cylinders on the
crank-case. The cylinder is provided with a flange that
registers with a corresponding member of the same diameter
on the crank-case. A U section, split clamping ring
is bolted in place as shown, this holding both flanges
firmly together and keeping the cylinder firmly seated
against the crank-case flange. The &#8220;monosoupape&#8221; type
has also been copied and has received some application
in Germany, but the most successful German airplanes
are powered with six-cylinder vertical engines such as
the Benz and Mercedes.</p>

<h3><a name="SecXII_8" id="SecXII_8"></a>THE LE RHONE MOTOR</h3>

<p>The Le Rhone motor is a radial revolving cylinder
engine that has many of the principles which are incorporated
in the Gnome but which are considered to be an
improvement by many foreign aviators. Instead of having
but one valve in the cylinder head, as the latest type
&#8220;monosoupape&#8221; Gnome has, the Le Rhone has two valves,
one for intake and one for exhaust in each cylinder. By
an ingenious rocker arm and tappet rod arrangement
it is possible to operate both valves with a single push
rod. Inlet pipes communicate with the crank-case at one
end and direct the fresh gas to the inlet valve cage at the
other. Another peculiarity in the design is the method
of holding the cylinders in place. Instead of having a
vertically divided crank-case as the Gnome engine has
and clamping both halves of the case around the cylinders,
the crank-case of the Le Rhone engine is in the
form of a cylinder having nine bosses provided with
threaded openings into which the cylinders are screwed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
A thread is provided at the base of each cylinder and
when the cylinder has been screwed down the proper
amount it is prevented from further rotation about its
own axis by a substantial lock nut which screws down
against the threaded boss on the crank-case. The external
appearance of the Le Rhone type motor is clearly
shown at <a href="#Fig215">Fig. 215</a>, while the general features of construction
are clearly outlined in the sectional views given
at <a href="#Fig216">Figs. 216</a> and <a href="#Fig217">217</a>.</p>

Big End Arrangement.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>The two main peculiarities of this motor are the
method of valve actuation by two large cams and the
distinctive crank-shaft and connecting rod big end construction.
The connecting rods are provided with &#8220;feet&#8221;
or shoes on the end which fit into grooves lined with
bearing metal which are machined into crank discs
revolving on ball bearings and which are held together so
that the connecting rod big ends are sandwiched between
them by clamping screws. This construction is a modification
of that used on the Anzani six-cylinder radial
engine. There are three grooves machined in each crank
disc and three connecting rod big ends run in each pair
of grooves. The details of this construction can be readily
ascertained by reference to explanatory diagrams at
<a href="#Fig218">Figs. 218</a> and <a href="#Fig219">219</a>, A.
Three of the rods which work<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
in the groove nearest the crank-pin are provided with
short shoes as shown at <a href="#Fig219">Fig. 219</a>, B. The short shoes
are used on the rods employed in cylinders number 1,
4, and 7. The set of connecting rods that work in the
central grooves are provided with medium-length shoes
and actuate the pistons in cylinders numbers 3, 6, and 9.
The three rods that work in the outside grooves have still
longer shoes and are employed in cylinders numbers 2,
5, and 8. The peculiar profile of the inlet and exhaust
cam plates are shown at C, <a href="#Fig219">Fig. 219</a>, while the construction
of the wrist-pin, wrist-pin bushing and piston are
clearly outlined at the sectional view at E. The method<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
of valve actuation is clearly outlined at <a href="#Fig220">Fig. 220</a>, which
shows an end section through the cam case and also
a partial side elevation showing one of the valve operating
levers which is fulcrumed at a central point and which
has a roller at one end bearing on one cam while the
roller or cam follower at the other end bears on the other
cam. The valve rocker arm actuating rod is, of course,
operated by this simple lever and is attached to it in
such a way that it can be pulled down to depress the
inlet valve and pushed up to open the exhaust valve.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>A carburetor of peculiar construction is employed in
the Le Rhone engine, this being a very simple type as
outlined at <a href="#Fig221">Fig. 221</a>. It is attached to the threaded end
of the hollow crank-shaft by a right and left coupling.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
The fuel is pumped to the spray nozzle, the opening in
which is controlled by a fuel regulating needle having
a long taper which is lifted out of the jet opening when
the air-regulating slide is moved. The amount of fuel
supplied the carburetor is controlled by a special needle
valve fitting which combines a filter screen and which is
shown at B. In regulating the speed of the Le Rhone
engine, there are two possible means of controlling the
mixture, one by altering the position of the air-regulating
slide, which also works the metering needle in the jet, and
the other by controlling the amount of fuel supplied to
the spray nozzle through the special fitting provided for
that purpose.</p>

<p>In considering the action of this engine one can refer
to <a href="#Fig222">Fig. 222</a>. The crank O. M. is fixed, while the cylinders
can turn about the crank-shaft center O and the piston<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
turns around the crank-pin M, because of the eccentricity
of the centers of rotation the piston will reciprocate in
the cylinders. This distance is at its maximum when
the cylinder is above O and at a minimum when it is
above M, and the difference between these two positions
is equal to the stroke, which is twice the distance of the
crank-throw O, M. The explosion pressure resolves itself
into the force F exerted along the line of the connecting
rod A, M, and also into a force N, which tends to make
the cylinders rotate around point O in the direction of
the arrow. An odd number of cylinders acting on one
crank-pin is desirable to secure equally spaced explosions,
as the basic action is the same as the Gnome engine.</p>

<p>The magneto is driven by a gear having 36 teeth attached
to crank-case which meshes with 16-tooth pinion
on armature. The magneto turns at 2.25 times crank-case
speed. Two cams, one for inlet, one for exhaust,
are mounted on a carrying member and act on nine
rocker arms which are capable of giving a push-and-pull<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
motion to the valve-actuating rocker-operating rods. A
gear driven by the crank-case meshes with a larger member
having internal teeth carried by the cam carrier.
Each cam has five profiles and is mounted in staggered
relation to the other. These give the nine fulcrumed
levers the proper motion to open the inlet and exhaust
valves at the proper time. The cams are driven at
<sup>45</sup>&#8260;<sub>50</sub> or <sup>9</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub> of the motor speed. The cylinder dimensions
and timing follows; the weight can be approximated by
figuring 3 pounds per horse-power.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 225.&mdash;Diagrams Showing How Cylinder Cooling is Effected in
Renault Vee Engines.</p></div>

<p>Air-cooled stationary engines are rarely used in airplanes,
but the Renault Fr&egrave;res of France have for several
years manufactured a complete series of such engines of
the general design shown at <a href="#Fig225">Fig. 225</a>, ranging from
a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
low-powered one developed eight or nine years ago and
rated at 40 and 50 horse-power, to later eight-cylinder
models rated at 70 horse-power and a twelve-cylinder, or
twin six, rated at 90 horse-power. The cylinders are of
cast iron and are furnished with numerous cooling ribs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
which are cast integrally. The cylinder heads are separate
castings and are attached to the cylinder as in early
motorcycle engine practice, and serve to hold the cylinder
in place on the aluminum alloy crank-case by a cruciform
yoke and four long hold-down bolts (<a href="#Fig226">Fig. 226</a>). The
pistons are of cast steel and utilize piston rings of cast
iron. The valves are situated on the inner side of the
cylinder head, the arrangement being unconventional in
that the exhaust valves are placed above the inlet. The
inlet valves seat in an extension of the combustion head
and are actuated by direct push rod and cam in the usual
manner while an overhead gear in which rockers are operated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
by push rods is needed to actuate the exhaust valves.
The valve action is clearly shown in <a href="#Fig226">Figs. 226</a> and <a href="#Fig227">227</a>.
The air stream by which the cylinders are cooled is produced
by a centrifugal or blower type fan of relatively
large diameter which is mounted on the end of a crank-shaft
and the air blast is delivered from this blower into
an enclosed space between the cylinder from which it
escapes only after passing over the cooling fins. In
spite of the fact that considerable prejudice exists against
air-cooling fixed cylinder engines, the Renault has given
very good service in both England and France.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 227.&mdash;Side Sectional View of Renault Twelve-Cylinder Air-Cooled Aviation Engine Crank-Case, Showing Use
of Plain and Ball Bearings for Crank-Shaft Support.</p></div>

<p>As will be seen by the sectional view at <a href="#Fig227">Fig. 227</a>, the
steel crank-shaft is carried in a combination of plain
bearings inside the crank-case and by ball bearings at the
ends. Owing to air cooling, special precautions are taken
with the lubrication system, though the lubrication is not
forced or under high pressure. An oil pump of the gear-wheel
type delivers oil from the sump at the bottom of the
crank-case to a chamber above, from which the oil flows
by gravity along suitable channels to the various main
bearings. It flows from the bearings into hollow rings
fastened to the crank-webs, and the oil thrown from the
whirling connecting rod big ends bathes the internal
parts in an oil mist. In the eight-cylinder designs ignition
is effected by a magneto giving four sparks per revolution
and is accordingly driven at engine speed. In the
twelve-cylinder machine two magnetos of the ordinary
revolving armature or two-spark type, each supplying
six cylinders, are fitted as outlined at <a href="#Fig228">Fig. 228</a>. The
carburetor is a float feed form. Warm air is supplied
for Winter and damp weather by air pipes surrounding
the exhaust pipes. The normal speed of the Renault
engine is 1,800 R.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;M., but as the propeller is mounted
upon an extension of the cam-shaft the normal propeller
speed is but half that of the engine, which makes it possible
to use a propeller of large diameter and high efficiency.
Owing to the air cooling, but low compression
may be used, this being about 60 pounds per square inch,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
which, of course, lowers the mean effective pressure and
makes the engine less efficient than water-cooled forms
where it is possible to use compression pressure of 100<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511"></a></span>
or more pounds per square inch. The 70 horse-power
engine has cylinders with a bore of 3.78 inches and a
stroke of 5.52 inches. Its weight is given as 396 pounds,
when in running order, which figures 5.7 pounds per
horse-power. The same cylinder size is used on the
twelve-cylinder 100 horse-power and the stroke is the
same. This engine in running order weighs 638 pounds,
which figures approximately 6.4 pounds per B.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;P.</p>

<h3><a name="SecXII_10" id="SecXII_10"></a>SIMPLEX MODEL &#8220;A&#8221; HISPANO-SUIZA</h3>

<p>The Model A is of the water-cooled four-cycle Vee
type, with eight cylinders, 4.7245 inch bore by 5.1182 inch
stroke, piston displacement 718 cubic inches. At sea-level
it develops 150 horse-power at 1,450 R.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;M. It can
be run successfully at much higher speeds, depending
on propeller design and gearing, developing proportionately
increased power. The weight, including carburetor,
two magnetos, propeller hub, starting magneto and crank,
but without radiator, water or oil or exhaust pipes, is
445 pounds. Average fuel consumption is .5 pound per
horse-power hour and the oil consumption at 1,450 R.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;M.
is three quarts per hour. The external appearance is
shown at <a href="#Fig230">Fig. 230</a>.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 230.&mdash;The Simplex Model A Hispano-Suiza Aviation Engine, a Very
Successful Form.</p></div>

<p>Four cylinders are contained in each block, which is
of built-up construction; the water jackets and valve
ports are cast aluminum and the individual cylinders
heat-treated steel forgings threaded into the bored holes
of the aluminum castings. Each block after assembly is
given a number of protective coats of enamel, both inside
and out, baked on. Coats on the inside are applied
under pressure. The pistons are aluminum castings,
ribbed. Connecting rods are tubular, of the forked type.
One rod bears directly on the crank-pin; the other rod
has a bearing on the outside of the one first mentioned.</p>

<p>The crank-shaft is of the five-bearing type, very short,
stiff in design, bored for lightness and for the oiling
system. The crank-shaft extension is tapered for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
French standard propeller hub, which is keyed and
locked to the shaft. This makes possible instant change
of propellers. The case is in two halves divided on the
center line of the crank-shaft, the bearings being fitted
between the upper and lower sections. The lower half
is deep, providing a large oil reservoir and stiffening
the engine. The upper half is simple and provides magneto
supports on extension ledges of the two main faces.
The valves are of large diameter with hollow stems,
working in cast iron bushings. They are directly operated
by a single hollow cam-shaft located over the valves. The
cam-shafts are driven from the crank-shaft by vertical
shafts and bevel gears. The cam-shafts, cams and heads
of the valve stems are all enclosed in oil-tight removable
housings of cast aluminum.</p>

<p>Oiling is by a positive pressure system. The oil is
taken through a filter and steel tubes cast in the case
to main bearings, through crank-shaft to crank-pins.
The fourth main bearing is also provided with an oil
lead from the system and through tubes running up the
end of each cylinder block, oil is provided for the cam-shafts,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
cams and bearings. The surplus oil escapes
through the end of the cam-shaft where the driving gears
are mounted, and with the oil that has gathered in the
top casing, descends through the drive shaft and gears
to the sump.</p>

<p>Ignition is by two eight-cylinder magnetos firing two
spark-plugs per cylinder. The magnetos are driven
from each of the two vertical shafts by small bevel
pinions meshing in bevel gears. The carburetor is
mounted between the two cylinder blocks and feeds the
two blocks through aluminum manifolds which are partly
water-jacketed. The engine can be equipped with a
geared hand crank-starting device.</p>

<h3>STURTEVANT MODEL 5A 140 HORSE-POWER ENGINE</h3>

<p>These motors are of the eight-cylinder &#8220;V&#8221; type, four-stroke
cycle, water-cooled, having a bore of 4 inches and
a stroke of 5<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches, equivalent to 102 mm. &times; 140 mm.
The normal operating speed of the crank-shaft is 2,000
R.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;M. The propeller shaft is driven through reducing
gears which can be furnished in different gear ratios.
The standard ratio is 5:3, allowing a propeller speed of
1,200 R.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;M.</p>

<p>The construction of the motor is such as to permit
of the application of a direct drive. The change from the
direct drive to gear drive, or vice versa, can be accomplished
in approximately one hour.</p>

<p>The cylinders are cast in pairs from an aluminum
alloy and are provided with steel sleeves, carefully fitted
into each cylinder. A perfect contact is secured between
cylinder and sleeve; at the same time a sleeve can be
replaced without injury to the cylinder proper. No difficulties
due to expansion occur on account of the rapid
transmission of heat and the fact that the sleeve is always
at higher temperature than the cylinder. A moulded
copper asbestos gasket is placed between the cylinder
and the head, permitting the cooling water to circulate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>
freely and at the same time insuring a tight joint. The
cylinder heads are cast in pairs from an aluminum alloy
and contain ample water passages for circulation of
cooling water over the entire head. Trouble due to hot
valves is thereby eliminated, a most important consideration
in the operation of an aeroplane motor. The
water jacket of the head corresponds to the water jacket
of the cylinders and large openings in both allow the
unobstructed circulation of the cooling water. The cylinder
heads and cylinders are both held to the base by six
long bolts. The valves are located in the cylinder heads
and are mechanically operated. The valves and valve
springs are especially accessible and of such size as to
permit high volumetric efficiency. The valves are constructed
of hardened tungsten steel, the heads and stems
being made from one piece. The valve rocker arms
located on the top of the cylinder are provided with
adjusting screws. A check nut enables the adjusting
screw to be securely locked in position, once the correct
clearance has been determined. The rocker arm bearings
are adequately lubricated by a compression grease cup.
Cam-rollers are interposed between the cams and the
push rods in order to reduce the side thrust on the push
rods.</p>

<p>A system of double springs is employed which greatly
reduces the stress on each spring and insures utmost
reliability. A spring of extremely large diameter returns
the valve; a second spring located at the cylinder base
handles the push rod linkage. These springs, which
operate under low stress, are made from the best of steel
and are given a special double heat treatment. The
pistons are made from a special aluminum alloy; are
deeply ribbed in the head for cooling and strength and
provided with two piston rings. These pistons are exceedingly
light weight in order to minimize vibration and
prevent wear on the bearings. The piston pin is made of
chrome nickel steel, bored hollow and hardened. It is
allowed to turn, both in piston and connecting rod. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>
piston rings are of special design, developed after years
of experimenting in aeronautical engines.</p>

<p>The connecting rods are of &#8220;H&#8221; section, machined
all over from forgings of a special air-hardening chrome
nickel steel which, after being heat treated has a tensile
strength of 280,000 pounds per square inch. They are
consequently very strong and yet unusually light, and
being machined all over are of absolutely uniform section,
which gives as nearly perfect balance as can be obtained.
The big ends are lined with white metal and the small
ends are bushed with phosphor bronze. The connecting
rods are all alike and take their bearings side by side on
the crank-pin, the cylinders being offset to permit of
this arrangement. The crank-shaft is machined from
the highest grade chrome nickel steel, heat treated in
order to obtain the best properties of this material.
It is 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inches in diameter (57 mm.) and bored hollow
throughout, insuring maximum strength with minimum
weight. It is carried in three large, bronze-backed white
metal bearings. A new method of producing these bearings
insures a perfect bond between the two metals and
eliminates breakage.</p>

<p>The base is cast from an aluminum alloy. Great
strength and rigidity is combined with light weight. The
sides extend considerably below the center line of the
crank-shaft, providing an extremely deep section. At
all highly stressed points, deep ribs are provided to distribute
the load evenly and eliminate bending. The lower
half of the base is of cast aluminum alloy of extreme
lightness. This collects the lubricating oil and acts as
a small reservoir for same. An oil-filtering screen of
large area covers the entire surface of the sump. The
propeller shaft is carried on two large annular ball bearings
driven from the crank-shaft by hardened chrome
nickel steel spur gears. These gears are contained within
an oil-tight casing integral with the base on the opposite
end from the timing gears. A ball-thrust bearing
is provided on the propeller shaft to take the thrust of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>
a propeller or tractor, as the case may be. In case of the
direct drive a stub shaft is fastened direct to the crank-shaft
and is fitted with a double thrust bearing.</p>

<p>The cam-shaft is contained within the upper half of
the base between the two groups of cylinders, and is
supported in six bronze bearings. It is bored hollow
throughout and the cams are formed integral with the
shaft and ground to the proper shape and finish. An
important development in the shape of cams has resulted
in a maintained increase of power at high speeds. The
gears operating the cam-shaft, magneto, oil and water
pumps are contained within an oil-tight casing and operate
in a bath of oil.</p>

<p>Lubrication is of the complete forced circulating system,
the oil being supplied to every bearing under high
pressure by a rotary pump of large capacity. This is
operated by gears from the crank-shaft. The oil passages
from the pump to the main bearings are cast integral
with the base, the hollow crank-shaft forming a passage
through the connecting rod bearings and the hollow cam-shaft
distributing the oil to the cam-shaft bearings. The
entire surface of the lower half of the base is covered
with a fine mesh screen through which the oil passes
before reaching the pump. Approximately one gallon of
oil is contained within the base and this is continually
circulated through an external tank by a secondary pump
operated by an eccentric on the cam-shaft. This also
draws fresh oil from the external tank which can be made
of any desired capacity.</p>

<h3><a name="SecXII_11" id="SecXII_11"></a>THE CURTISS AVIATION MOTORS</h3>

<p>The Curtiss OX motor has eight cylinders, 4-inch
bore, 5-inch stroke, delivers 90 horse-power at 1,400 turns,
and the weight turns out at 4.17 pounds per horse-power.
This motor has cast iron cylinders with monel metal
jackets, overhead inclined valves operated by means of
two rocker arms, push-and-pull rods from the central
cam-shaft located in the crank-case. The cam and push
rod design is extremely ingenious and the whole valve
construction turns out very light. This motor is an
evolution from the early Curtiss type motor which was
used by Glenn Curtiss when he won the Gordon Bennett
Cup at Rheims. A slightly larger edition of this type
motor is the OXX-5, as shown at <a href="#Fig231">Figs. 231</a> and <a href="#Fig232">232</a>,
which has cylinders 4<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inches by 5 inches, delivers 100
horse-power at 1,400 turns and has the same fuel and
oil consumption as the OX type motor, namely, .60 pound
of fuel per brake horse-power hour and .03 pound of
lubricating oil per brake horse-power hour.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="Fig231" id="Fig231"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 231.&mdash;The Curtiss OXX-5 Aviation Engine is an Eight-Cylinder Type
Largely Used on Training Machines.</p></div>

<p>The Curtiss Company have developed in the last
two years a larger-sized motor now known as the V-2,
which was originally rated at 160 horse-power and which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
has since been refined and improved so that the motor
gives 220 horse-power at 1,400 turns, with a fuel consumption
of <sup>52</sup>&#8260;<sub>100</sub> of a pound per brake horse-power hour
and an oil consumption of .02 of a pound per brake
horse-power hour. This larger motor has a weight of 3.45
pounds per horse-power and is now said to be giving
very satisfactory service. The V-2 motor has drawn
steel cylinders, with a bore of 5 inches and a stroke of
7 inches, with a steel water jacket top and a monel metal
cylindrical jacket, both of which are brazed on to the
cylinder barrel itself. Both these motors use side by
side connecting rods and fully forced lubrication. The
cam-shafts act as a gallery from which the oil is distributed
to the cam-shaft bearings, the main crank-shaft<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
bearings, and the gearing. Here again we find extremely
short rods, which, as before mentioned, enables the height
and the consequent weight of construction to be very
much reduced. For ordinary flying at altitudes of 5,000
to 6,000 feet, the motors are sent out with an aluminum
liner, bolted between the cylinder and the crank-case in
order to give a compression ratio which does not result
in pre-ignition at a low altitude. For high flying, however,
these aluminum liners are taken out and the compression<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
volume is decreased to about 18.6 per cent. of
the total volume.</p>

<h3><a name="SecXII_12" id="SecXII_12"></a>THOMAS-MORSE MODEL 88 ENGINE</h3>

<p>The Thomas-Morse Aircraft Corporation of Ithaca,
N. Y., has produced a new engine, Model 88, bearing a
close resemblance to the earlier model. The main features
of that model have been retained; in fact, many parts
are interchangeable in the two engines. Supported by
the great development in the wide use of aluminum, the
Thomas engineers have adopted this material for cylinder
construction, which adoption forms the main departure
from previous accepted design.</p>

<p>The marked tendency to-day toward a higher speed
of rotation has been conclusively justified, in the opinion
of the Thomas engineers, by the continued reliable performance
of engines with crank-shafts operating at speeds
near 2,000 revolutions per minute, driving the propeller
through suitable gearing at the most efficient speed.
High speed demands that the closest attention be paid
to the design of reciprocating and rotating parts and
their adjacent units. Steel of the highest obtainable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
tensile strength must be used for connecting rods and
piston pins, that they may be light and yet retain a
sufficient factor of safety. Piston design is likewise
subjected to the same strict scrutiny. At the present
day, aluminum alloy pistons operate so satisfactorily
that they may be said to have come to stay.</p>

<p>The statement often made in the past, that the gearing
down of an engine costs more in the weight of reduction
gears and propeller shaft than is warranted by
the increase in horse-power, is seldom heard to-day.</p>

<p>The mean effective pressure remaining the same, the
brake horse-power of any engine increases as the speed.
That is, an engine delivering 100 brake horse-power at
1,500 revolutions per minute will show 133 brake horse-power
at 2,000 revolutions per minute, an increase of 33
brake horse-power. To utilize this increase in horse-power,
a matter of some fifteen pounds must be spent
in gearing and another fifteen perhaps on larger valves,
bearings, etc. Two per cent. may be assumed lost in
the gears. In other words, the increase in horse-power
due to increasing the speed has been attained at the
expense of about one pound per brake horse-power.</p>

<p>The advantages of the eight-cylinder engine over the
six and twelve, briefly stated, are: lower weight per horse-power,
shorter length, simpler and stiffer crank-shaft,
cam-shaft and crank-case, and simpler and more direct
manifold arrangement. As to torque, the eight is superior
to the six, and yet in practice not enough inferior
to the twelve to warrant the addition of four more
cylinders. It must, however, be recognized that the
eight is subject to the action of inherent unbalanced
inertia couples, which set up horizontal vibrations, impossible
of total elimination. These vibrations are functions
of the reciprocating weights, which, as already
mentioned, are cut down to the minimum. Vibrations
due to the elasticity of crank-case, crank-shaft, etc., can
be and are reduced in the Thomas engine to minor
quantities by ample webbing of the crank-case and judicious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
use of metal elsewhere. All things considered,
there is actually so little difference to be discerned between
the balance of a properly designed eight-cylinder
engine and that of a six or twelve as to make a discussion
of the pros and cons more one of theory than
of practice.</p>

<p>The main criticisms of the L head cylinder engine are
that it is less efficient and heavier. This is granted, as it
relates to cylinders alone. More thorough investigation,
however, based on the main desideratum, weight-power
ratio, leads us to other conclusions, particularly with
reference to high speed engines. The valve gear must
not be forgotten. A cylinder cannot be taken completely
away from its component parts and judged, as to its
weight value, by itself alone. A part away from the whole
becomes an item unimportant in comparison with the
whole. The valve gear of a high speed engine is a too
often overlooked feature. The stamp of approval has
been made by high speed automobile practice upon the
overhead cam-shaft drive, with valves in the cylinder
head operated direct from the cam-shaft or by means of
valve lifters or short rockers.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="Fig233" id="Fig233"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 233.&mdash;End View of Thomas-Morse 150 Horse-Power Aluminum Cylinder
Aviation Motor Having Detachable Cylinder Heads.</p></div>

<p>The overhead cam-shaft mechanism applied to an
eight-cylinder engine calls for two separate cam-shafts
carried above and supported by the cylinders in an oil-tight
housing, and driven by a series of spur gears or
bevels from the crank-shaft. It is patent that this valve
gearing is heavy and complicated in comparison with
the simple moving valve units of the L head engine,
which are operated from one single cam-shaft, housed
rigidly in the crank-case. The inherently lower volumetric
efficiency of the L head engine is largely overcome
by the use of a properly designed head, large valves and
ample gas passages. Again, the customary use of a dual
ignition system gives to the L head a relatively better
opportunity for the advantageous placing of spark-plugs,
in order that better flame propagation and complete
combustion may be secured.</p>

<p>This engine is a four-cylinder, <span class="nowrap">4<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>&#8242;&#8242;</span>
&times; <span class="nowrap">7&#8242;&#8242;,</span> 125 horse-power
at 2,100 R.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;M. of the crank-shaft and 1,210
R.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;M. of the propeller. Motors are sold on above
rating; actual power tests prove this motor capable of
developing 140 horse-power at 2,100 R.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;M. of the
motor. The exact weight with magneto, carburetor, gear
reduction and propeller hub, as illustrated, 509 pounds;
without gear reduction, 436 pounds. This motor has
been produced as a power plant weighing 3.5 pounds per
horse-power, yet nothing has been sacrificed in rigidity
and strength. At its normal speed it develops 1 horse-power<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
for every 3.5 cubic inches piston displacement.
Cylinders are semi-steel, with aluminum plates enclosing
water jackets. Pistons specially ribbed and made of
Magnalite aluminum compound. Piston rings are special
Duesenberg design, being three-piece rings. Valves are
tungsten steel, <span class="nowrap">1<sup>15</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub>&#8242;&#8242;</span>
inlets and <span class="nowrap">2&#8242;&#8242;</span> exhausts, two of each
to each cylinder. Arranged horizontally in the head,
allowing very thorough water-jacketing. Inlet valves in
cages. Exhaust valves, seating directly in the cylinder
head, are removable through the inlet valve holes. Valve
stems lubricated by splash in the valve action covers.
Valve rocker arms forged with cap screw and nut at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span>
upper end to adjust clearance. Entirely enclosed by
aluminum housing, as is entire valve mechanism. Connecting
rods are tubular, chrome nickel steel, light and
strong. Crank-shaft is one-piece forging, hollow bored,
2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>-inch diameter at main bearings. Connecting rod
bearings, 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>-inch diameter, 3 inches long. Front main
bearing, 3<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches long; intermediate main bearing,
3<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches long; rear main bearing, 4 inches long. Crank-case
of aluminum, barrel type, oil pan on bottom removable.
Hand hole plates on both sides. Strongly webbed.</p>

<p>The oiling system of this sixteen-valve Duesenberg
motor is one of its vital features. An oil pump located
in the base and submerged in oil forces oil through cored
passages to the three main bearings, then through tubes
under each connecting rod into which the rod dips. The
oil is thrown off from these and lubricates every part of
the motor. This constitutes the main oiling system; it is
supplemented by a splash system, there being a trough
under each connecting rod into which the rod slips. The
oil is returned to the main supply sump by gravity,
where it is strained and re-used. Either system is in
itself sufficient to operate the motor. A pressure gauge
is mounted for observation on a convenient part of the
system. A pressure of approximately 25 pounds is
maintained by the pressure system, which insures efficient
lubrication at all speeds of the motor. The troughs
under the connecting rods are so constructed that no
matter what the angle of flight may be, oil is retained
in each individual trough so that each connecting rod
can dip up its supply of oil at each revolution.</p>

<h3><a name="SecXII_14" id="SecXII_14"></a>AEROMARINE SIX-CYLINDER VERTICAL MOTOR</h3>

<p>These motors are four-stroke cycle, six-cylinder vertical
type, with cylinder <span class="nowrap">4<sup>5</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub>&#8242;&#8242;</span> bore by <span class="nowrap">5<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>&#8242;&#8242;</span> stroke. The
general appearance of this motor is shown in illustration
at <a href="#Fig236">Fig. 236</a>. This engine is rated at 85-90 horse-power.
All reciprocating and revolving parts of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
motor are made of the highest grades of steel obtainable
as are the studs, nuts and bolts. The upper and lower
parts of crank-case are made of composition aluminum
casting. Lower crank-case is made of high grade aluminum
composition casting and is bolted directly to the
upper half. The oil reservoir in this lower half casting
provides sufficient oil capacity for five hours&#8217; continuous
running at full power. Increased capacity can be provided
if needed to meet greater endurance requirements.
Oil is forced under pressure to all bearings by means of
high-pressured duplex-geared pumps. One side of this
pump delivers oil under pressure to all the bearings,
while the other side draws the oil from the splash case
and delivers it to the main sump. The oil reservoir is
entirely separate from the crank-case chamber. Under
no circumstances will oil flood the cylinder, and the oiling
system is not affected in any way by any angle of flight
or position of motor. An oil pressure gauge is placed
on instrument board of machine, which gives at all times<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>
the pressure in oil system, and a sight glass at lower
half of case indicates the amount of oil contained. The
oil pump is external on magneto end of motor, and is
very accessible. An external oil strainer is provided,
which is removable in a few minutes&#8217; time without the
loss of any oil. All oil from reservoir to the motor passes
through this strainer. Pressure gauge feed is also attached
and can be piped to any part of machine desired.</p>

<p>The cylinders are made of high-grade castings and
are machined and ground accurately to size. Cylinders
are bolted to crank-case with chrome nickel steel studs
and nuts which securely lock cylinder to upper half of
crank-case. The main retaining cylinder studs go
through crank-case and support crank-shaft bearings so
that crank-shaft and cylinders are tied together as one
unit. Water jackets are of copper, <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub>&#8242;&#8242;</span> thick, electrically
deposited. This makes a non-corrosive metal. Cooling
is furnished by a centrifugal pump, which delivers 25
gallons per minute at 1,400 R.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;M. Pistons are made
cast iron, accurately machined and ground to exact dimensions,
which are carefully balanced. Piston rings are
semi-steel rings of Aeromarine special design.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>Connecting rods are of chrome nickel steel, H-section.
Crank-shaft is made of chrome nickel steel, machined all
over, and cut from solid billet, and is accurately balanced
through the medium of balance weights being
forged integral with crank. It is drilled for lightness and
plugged for force feed lubrication. There are seven
main bearings to crank-shaft. All bearings are of high-grade
babbitt, die cast, and are interchangeable and easily
replaced. The main bearings of the crank-shaft are
provided with a single groove to take oil under pressure
from pressure tube which is cast integral with case.
Connecting rod bearings are of the same type. The
gudgeon pin is hardened, ground and secured in connecting
rod, and is allowed to work in piston. Cam-shaft
is of steel, with cams forged integral, drilled for lightness
and forced-feed lubrication, and is case-hardened.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
The bearings of cam-shaft are of bronze. Magneto, two
high-tension Bosch D. U. 6. The intake manifold for
carburetors are aluminum castings and are so designed
that each carburetor feeds three cylinders, thereby insuring
easy flow of vapor at all speeds. Weight, 420 pounds.</p>

<h3><a name="SecXII_15" id="SecXII_15"></a>WISCONSIN AVIATION ENGINES</h3>

<p>The new six-cylinder Wisconsin aviation engines, one
of which is shown at <a href="#Fig237">Fig. 237</a>, are of the vertical type,
with cylinders in pairs and valves in the head. Dimensioned
drawings of the six-cylinder vertical type are
given at <a href="#Fig238">Figs. 238</a> and <a href="#Fig239">239</a>. The cylinders are made of
aluminum alloy castings, are bored and machined and
then fitted with hardened steel sleeves about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub> inch in
thickness. After these sleeves have been shrunk into
the cylinders, they are finished by grinding in place.
Gray iron valve seats are cast into the cylinders. The
valve seats and cylinders, as well as the valve ports, are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>
entirely surrounded by water jackets. The valves set
in the heads at an angle of <span class="nowrap">25&deg;</span> from the vertical, are
made of tungsten steel and are provided with double
springs, the outer or main spring and the inner or auxiliary
spring, which is used as a precautionary measure
to prevent a valve falling into the cylinder in remote
case of a main spring breaking. The cam-shaft is made
of one solid forging, case-hardened. It is carried in an
aluminum housing bolted to the top of the cylinders.
This housing is split horizontally, the upper half carrying
the chrome vanadium steel rocker levers. The lower half
has an oil return trough cast integral, into which the
excess oil overflows and then drains back to the crank-case.
Small inspection plates are fitted over the cams
and inner ends of the cam rocker levers. The cam-shaft
runs in bronze bearings and the drive is through vertical
shaft and bevel gears.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="Fig237" id="Fig237"></a>

<p>The crank-case is made of aluminum, the upper half<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>
carrying the bearings for the crank-shaft. The lower
half carries the oil sump in which all of the oil except
that circulating through the system at the time is carried.
The crank-shaft is made of chrome vanadium steel of
an elastic limit of 115,000 pounds. The crank-pins and
ends of the shaft are drilled for lightness and the cheeks
are also drilled for oil circulation. The crank-shaft runs
in bronze-backed, Fahrig metal-lined bearings, four in
number. A double thrust bearing is also provided, so
that the motor may be used either in a tractor or pusher
type of machine. Outside of the thrust bearing an annular
ball bearing is used to take the radial load of the
propeller. The propeller is mounted on a taper. At the
opposite end of the shaft a bevel gear is fitted which
drives the cam-shaft, through a vertical shaft, and also
drives the water and oil pumps and magnetos. All gears
are made of chrome vanadium steel, heat-treated.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 238.&mdash;Dimensioned End Elevation of Wisconsin Six Motor.</p></div>

<p>The connecting rods are tubular and machined from
chrome vanadium steel forgings. Oil tubes are fitted to
the rods which carry the oil up to the wrist-pins and
pistons. The rods complete with bushings weigh 5<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>
pounds each. The pistons are made of aluminum alloy
and are very light and strong, weighing only 2 pounds
2 ounces each. Two leak-proof rings are fitted to each
piston. The wrist-pins are hollow, of hardened steel,
and are free to turn either in the piston or the rod. A
bronze bushing is fitted in the upper end of the rod, but
no bushing is fitted in the pistons, the hardened steel
wrist-pins making an excellent bearing in the aluminum
alloy.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a name="Fig239" id="Fig239"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 239.&mdash;Dimensioned Side Elevation of Wisconsin Six Motor.</p></div>

<p>The water circulation is by centrifugal pump, which
is mounted at the lower end of the vertical shaft. The
water is pumped through brass pipes to the lower end
of the cylinder water jackets and leaves the upper end
of the jackets just above the exhaust valves. The lubricating
system is one of the main features of the engines,
being designed to work with the motor at any angle.
The oil is carried in the sump, from where it is taken<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span>
by the oil circulating pump through a strainer and forced
through a header, extending the full length of the crank-case,
and distributed to the main bearings. From the
main bearings it is forced through the hollow crank-shaft
to the connecting rod big ends and then through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span>
tubes on the rods to wrist-pins and pistons. Another
lead takes oil from the main header to the cam-shaft
bearings. The oil forced out of the ends of the cam-shaft
bearings fills pockets under the cams and in the
cam rocker levers. The excess flows back through pipes
and through the train of gears to the crank-case. A
strainer is fitted at each end of the crank-case, through
which the oil is drawn by separate pumps and returned
to the sump. Either one of these pumps is large enough
to take care of all of the return oil, so that the operation
is perfect whether the motor is inclined up or down. No
splash is used in the crank-case, the system being a
full force feed. An oil level indicator is provided, showing
the amount of oil in the sump at all times. The oil
pressure in these motors is carried at ten pounds, a
relief valve being fitted to hold the pressure constant.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="Fig240" id="Fig240"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 240.&mdash;Power, Torque and Efficiency Curves of Wisconsin Aviation
Motor.</p></div>

<p>Ignition is by two Bosch magnetos, each on a separate
set of plugs fired simultaneously on opposite sides of the
cylinders. Should one magneto fail, the other would still
run the engine at only a slight loss in power. The Zenith
double carburetor is used, three cylinders being supplied
by each carburetor. This insures a higher volumetric
efficiency, which means more power, as there is no overlapping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span>
of inlet valves whatever by this arrangement.
All parts of these motors are very accessible. The water
and oil pumps, carburetors, magnetos, oil strainer or
other parts can be removed without disturbing other
parts. The lower crank-case can be removed for inspection
or adjustment of bearings, as the crank-shaft and
bearing caps are carried by the upper half. The motor
supporting lugs are also part of the upper crank-case.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 241.&mdash;Timing Diagram, Wisconsin Aviation Engine.</p></div>

<p>The six-cylinder motor, without carburetors or magnetos,
weighs 547 pounds. With carburetor and magnetos,
the weight is 600 pounds. The weight of cooling
water in the motor is 38 pounds. The sump will carry
4 gallons of oil, or about 28 pounds. A radiator can be
furnished suitable for the motor, weighing 50 pounds.
This radiator will hold 3 gallons of water or about 25
pounds. The motor will drive a two-blade, 8 feet diameter
by 6.25 feet pitch Paragon propeller 1400 revolutions
per minute, developing 148 horse-power. The weight of
this propeller is 42 pounds. This makes a total weight
of motor, complete with propeller, radiator filled with
water, but without lubricating oil, 755 pounds, or about
5.1 pounds per horse-power for complete power plant.
The fuel consumption is .5 pound per horse-power per
hour. The lubricating oil consumption is .0175 pound
per horse-power per hour, or a total of 2.6 pounds per
hour at 1400 revolutions per minute. This would make
the weight of fuel and oil, per hour&#8217;s run at full power
at 1400 revolutions per minute, 76.6 pounds.</p>

speed at which it is recommended to run these motors.</p>

<h3>TWELVE-CYLINDER ENGINE</h3>

<p>A twelve-cylinder V-type engine <a href="#Fig242">illustrated</a>, is also
being built by this company, similar in dimensions of
cylinders to the six. The principal differences being in
the drive to cam-shaft, which is through spur gears instead
of bevel. A hinged type of connecting rod is used
which does not increase the length of the motor and, at
the same time, this construction provides for ample bearings.
A double centrifugal water pump is provided for
this motor, so as to distribute the water uniformly to
both sets of cylinders. Four magnetos are used, two for
each set of six cylinders. The magnetos are very accessibly
located on a bracket on the spur gear cover. The
carburetors are located on the outside of the motors,
where they are very accessible, while the exhaust is in the
center of the valley. The crank-shaft on the twelve is
2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches in diameter and the shaft is bored to reduce
weight. Dimensioned drawings of the twelve-cylinder
engine are given at <a href="#Fig242">Figs. 242</a> and <a href="#Fig243">243</a> and should prove
useful for purposes of comparison with other motors.</p>

<h3><a name="SecXII_16" id="SecXII_16"></a>HALL-SCOTT AVIATION ENGINES</h3>

<p>The following specifications of the Hall-Scott &#8220;Big
Four&#8221; engines apply just as well to the six-cylinder
vertical types which are practically the same in construction
except for the structural changes necessary to accommodate
the two extra cylinders. Cylinders are cast<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span>
separately from a special mixture of semi-steel, having
cylinder head with valve seats integral. Special attention
has been given to the design of the water jacket around
the valves and head, there being two inches of water
space above same. The cylinder is annealed, rough
machined, then the inner cylinder wall and valve seats
ground to mirror finish. This adds to the durability of
the cylinder, and diminishes a great deal of the excess
friction.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span>Great care is taken in the casting and machining of
these cylinders, to have the bore and walls concentric
with each other. Small ribs are cast between outer and
inner walls to assist cooling as well as to transfer stresses
direct from the explosion to hold-down bolts which run
from steel main bearing caps to top of cylinders. The
cylinders are machined upon the sides so that when
assembled on the crank-case with grooved hold-down
washers tightened, they form a solid block, greatly assisting
the rigidity of crank-case.</p>

<p>The connecting rods are very light, being of the I
beam type, milled from a solid Chrome nickel die forging.
The caps are held on by two <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>&#8242;&#8242;-20</span> thread Chrome nickel
through bolts. The rods are first roughed out, then annealed.
Holes are drilled, after which the rods are hardened
and holes ground parallel with each other. The
piston end is fitted with a gun metal bushing, while the
crank-pin end carries two bronze serrated shells, which
are tinned and babbitted hot, being broached to harden
the babbitt. Between the cap and rod proper are placed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span>
laminated shims for adjustment. Crank-cases are cast of
the best aluminum alloy, hand scraped and sand blasted
inside and out. The lower oil case can be removed without
breaking any connections, so that the connecting rods
and other working parts can readily be inspected. An
extremely large strainer and dirt trap is located in the
center and lowest point of the case, which is easily removed
from the outside without disturbing the oil pump
or any working parts. A Zenith carburetor is provided.
Automatic valves and springs are absent, making the
adjustment simple and efficient. This carburetor is not
affected by altitude to any appreciable extent. A Hall-Scott
device, covered by U. S. Patent No. 1,078,919, allows
the oil to be taken direct from the crank-case and run
around the carburetor manifold, which assists carburetion
as well as reduces crank-case heat. Two waterproof four-cylinder
Splitdorf &#8220;Dixie&#8221; magnetos are provided. Both
magneto interruptors are connected to a rock shaft integral
with the motor, making outside connections unnecessary.
It is worthy of note that with this independent
double magneto system, one complete magneto can become
inoperative, and still the motor will run and continue to
give good power.</p>

<p>The pistons as provided in the A-7 engines are cast
from a mixture of steel and gray iron. These are extremely
light, yet provided with six deep ribs under the
arch head, greatly aiding the cooling of the piston as well
as strengthening it. The piston pin bosses are located
very low in order to keep the heat from the piston head
away from the upper end of the connecting rod, as well
as to arrange them at the point where the piston fits the
cylinder best. Three <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>&#8242;&#8242;</span> rings are carried. The pistons
as provided in the A-7a engines are cast from aluminum
alloy. Four <span class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>&#8242;&#8242;</span> rings are carried. In both piston types
a large diameter, heat treated, Chrome nickel steel wrist-pin
is provided, assembled in such a way as to assist the
circular rib between the wrist-pin bosses to keep the
piston from being distorted from the explosions.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>The oiling system is known as the high pressure type,
oil being forced to the under side of the main bearings
with from 5 to 30 points pressure. This system is not
affected by extreme angles obtained in flying, or whether
the motor is used for push or pull machines. A large
gear pump is located in the lowest point of the oil sump,
and being submerged at all times with oil, does away
with troublesome stuffing boxes and check valves. The
oil is first drawn from the strainer in oil sump to the long
jacket around the intake manifold, then forced to the
main distributor pipe in crank-case, which leads to all
main bearings. A bi-pass, located at one end of the
distributor pipe, can be regulated to provide any pressure
required, the surplus oil being returned to the case.
A special feature of this system is the dirt, water and
sediment trap, located at the bottom of the oil sump.
This can be removed without disturbing or dismantling
the oil pump or any oil pipes. A small oil pressure gauge
is provided, which can be run to the aviator&#8217;s instrument
board. This registers the oil pressure, and also determines
its circulation.</p>

<p>The cooling of this motor is accomplished by the oil
as well as the water, this being covered by patent No.
1,078,919. This is accomplished by circulating the oil
around a long intake manifold jacket; the carburetion
of gasoline cools this regardless of weather conditions.
Crank-case heat is therefore kept at a minimum. The
uniform temperature of the cylinders is maintained by
the use of ingenious internal outlet pipes, running through
the head of each of the six-cylinders, rubber hose connections
being used so that any one of the cylinders may
be removed without disturbing the others. Slots are cut
in these pipes so that cooler water is drawn directly
around the exhaust valves. Extra large water jackets
are provided upon the cylinders, two inches of water
space is left above the valves and cylinder head. The
water is circulated by a large centrifugal pump insuring
ample circulation at all speeds.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[542]</a></span>The crank-shaft is of the five bearing type, being
machined from a special heat treated drop forging of the
highest grade nickel steel. The forging is first drilled,
then roughed out. After this the shaft is straightened,
turned down to a grinding size, then ground accurately
to size. The bearing surfaces are of extremely large
size, over-size, considering general practice in the building
of high speed engines of similar bore and stroke.
The crank-shaft bearings are <span class="nowrap">2&#8242;&#8242;</span> in diameter
by <span class="nowrap">1<sup>15</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub>&#8242;&#8242;</span>
long, excepting the rear main bearing, which is <span class="nowrap">4<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>&#8242;&#8242;</span>
long, and front main bearing, which is <span class="nowrap">2<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub>&#8242;&#8242;</span> long. Steel
oil scuppers are pinned and sweated onto the webs of
the shaft, which allows of properly oiling the connecting
rod bearings. Two thrust bearings are installed on the
propeller end of the shaft, one for pull and the other for
push. The propeller is driven by the crank-shaft flange,
which is securely held in place upon the shaft by six
keys. These drive an outside propeller flange, the propeller
being clamped between them by six through bolts.
The flange is fitted to a long taper on crank-shaft. This
enables the propeller to be removed without disturbing
the bolts. Timing gears and starting ratchets are bolted
to a flange turned integral with shaft.</p>

<p>The cam-shaft is of the one piece type, air pump
eccentric, and gear flange being integral. It is made
from a low carbon specially heat treated nickel forging,
is first roughed out and drilled entire length; the cams
are then formed, after which it is case hardened and
ground to size. The cam-shaft bearings are extra long,
made from Parson&#8217;s White Brass. A small clutch is
milled in gear end of shaft to drive revolution indicator.
The cam-shaft is enclosed in an aluminum housing bolted
directly on top of all six cylinders, being driven by a
vertical shaft in connection with bevel gears. This shaft,
in conjunction with rocker arms, rollers and other working
parts, are oiled by forcing the oil into end of shaft,
using same as a distributor, allowing the surplus supply
to flow back into the crank-case through hollow vertical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span>
tube. This supply oils the magneto and pump gears.
Extremely large Tungsten valves, being one-half the cylinder
diameter, are seated in the cylinder heads. Large
diameter oil tempered springs held in tool steel cups,
locked with a key, are provided. The ports are very
large and short, being designed to allow the gases to enter
and exhaust with the least possible resistance. These
valves are operated by overhead one piece cam-shaft in
connection with short Chrome nickel rocker arms. These
arms have hardened tool steel rollers on cam end with
hardened tool steel adjusting screws opposite. This construction
allows accurate valve timing at all speeds with
least possible weight.</p>

<h3>GERMAN AIRPLANE MOTORS</h3>

<p>In a paper on &#8220;Aviation Motors,&#8221; presented by E. H.
Sherbondy before the Cleveland section of the S. A. E.
in June, 1917, the Mercedes and Benz airplane motor is
discussed in some detail and portions of the description
follow.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a name="Fig244" id="Fig244"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 244.&mdash;Side and End Sectional Views of Four-Cylinder Argus Engine, a German 100 Horse-Power Design Having
Bore and Stroke of 140 mm., or 5.60 inches, and Developing Its Power at 1,368 R.P.M. Weight, 350 Pounds.</p></div>

<h3><a name="SecXII_17" id="SecXII_17"></a>MERCEDES MOTOR</h3>

<p>The 150 horse-power six-cylinder Mercedes motor is
140 millimeters bore and 160 millimeters stroke. The
Mercedes company started with smaller-sized cylinders,
namely 100 millimeters bore and 140 millimeters stroke,
six-cylinders. The principal features of the design are
forged steel cylinders with forged steel elbows for gas
passages, pressed steel water jackets, which when welded
together forms the cylinder assembly, the use of inclined
overhead valves operated by means of an overhead cam-shaft
through rocker arms which multiply with the motion
of the cam. By the use of steel cylinders, not only
is the weight greatly reduced, but certain freedom from
distortion through unequal sections, leaks and cracks are
entirely avoided. The construction is necessarily very
expensive. It is certainly a sound job. In the details
of this construction there are a number of important
things, such as finished gas passages, water-cooled valve
guides and a very small mass of metal, which is water-cooled,
surrounding the spark-plug. Of course, it is necessary
to use very high compression in aviation motors
in order to secure high power and economy and owing to
the fact that aviation motors are worked at nearly their
maximum, the heat flow through the cylinder, piston, and
valves is many times higher than that encountered in
automobile motors. It has been found necessary to develop
special types of pistons to carry the heat from the
center of the head in order to prevent pre-ignition. In
the Mercedes motor the pistons have a drop forged steel
head which includes the piston boss and this head is
screwed into a cast iron skirt which has been machined
inside to secure uniform wall thickness.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span>The carburetor used on this 150 horse-power Mercedes
motor is precisely of the same type used on the
Twin Six motor. It has two venturi throats, in the center
of which is placed the gasoline spray nozzle of conventional
type, fixed size orifices, immediately above which
are placed two panel type throttles with side outlets.
An idling or primary nozzle is arranged to discharge
above the top of the venturi throat. The carburetor
body is of cast aluminum and is water jacketed. It is
bolted directly to air passage passing through the top
and bottom half of the crank-case which passes down
through the oil reservoir. The air before reaching the
carburetor proper to some extent has cooled the oil in
the crank chamber and has itself been heated to assist<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span>
in the vaporization. The inlet pipes themselves are copper.
All the passages between the venturi throat and
the inlet valve have been carefully finished and polished.
The only abnormal thing in the design of this motor is
the short connecting rod which is considerably less than
twice the stroke and would be considered very bad practice
in motor car engines. A short connecting rod, however,
possesses two very real virtues in that it cuts down height
of the motor and the piston passes over the bottom dead
center much more slowly than with a long rod.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 245.&mdash;Part Sectional View of 90 Horse-Power Mercedes Engine,
Which is Typical of the Design of Larger Sizes.</p></div>

<p>Other features of the design are a very stiff crank-case,
both halves of which are bolted together by means
of long through bolts, the crank-shaft main bearings are
seated in the lower half of the case instead of in the
usual caps and no provision is made for taking up the
main bearings. The Mercedes company uses a plunger<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span>
type of pump having mechanically operated piston valves
and it is driven by means of worm gearing.</p>

<p>The overhead cam-shaft construction is extremely
light. The cam-shaft is mounted in a nearly cylindrical
cast bronze case and is driven by means of bevel gears
from the crank-shaft. The vertical bevel gear shaft
through which the drive is taken from the crank-shaft to
the cam-shaft operates at one and one-half times the
crank-shaft speeds and the reduction to the half-time
cam-shaft is secured through a pair of bevels. On this
vertical shaft there is mounted the water pump and a
bevel gear for driving two magnetos. The water pump
mounted on this shaft tends to steady the drive and avoid
vibration in the gearing.</p>

<p>The largest of these motors has recently had its horsepower
increased to 176 at 1450 R.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;M. This general
design of motor has been the foundation for a great many
other aviation motor designs, some of which have proved
very successful but none of which is equal to the original.
Among the motors which follow more or less closely
the scheme of design and arrangement are the Hall-Scott,
the Wisconsin motor, the Renault water-cooled, the Packard,
the Christofferson and the Rolls-Royce. Each of
these motors show considerable variation in detail. The
Rolls-Royce and Renault are the only ones who have used
the steel cylinder with the steel jacket. The Wisconsin
motor uses an aluminum cylinder with a hardened steel
liner and cast-iron valve seats. The Christofferson has
somewhat similar design to the Wisconsin with the exception
that the valve seats are threaded into the aluminum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span>
jacket and the cylinder head has a blank end which
is secured to the aluminum casting by means of the valve
seat pieces. The Rolls-Royce motors show small differences
in details of design in cylinder head and cam-shaft
housing from the Mercedes on which it has taken out
patents, not only abroad but in this country.</p>

<h3><a name="SecXII_18" id="SecXII_18"></a>THE BENZ MOTOR</h3>

<p>In the Kaiser prize contest for aviation motors a four-cylinder
Benz motor of 130 by 180 mm. won first prize,
developing 103 B.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;P. at 1290 R.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;M. The fuel consumption
was 210 grams per horse-power hour. Total
weight of the motor was 153 kilograms. The oil consumption
was .02 of a kilogram per horse-power hour.
This motor was afterward expanded into a six-cylinder
design and three different sizes were built.</p>

<p>The Benz cylinder is a simple, straightforward design
and a very reliable construction and not particularly difficult
to manufacture. The cylinder is cast of iron without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>
a water jacket but including 45 degrees angle elbows to
the valve ports. The cylinders are machined wherever
possible and at other points have been hand filed and
scraped, after which a jacket, which is pressed in two
halves, is gas welded by means of short pipes welded on
to the jacket. The bottom and the top of the cylinders
become water galleries, and by this means separate water
pipes with their attendant weight and complication are
eliminated. Rubber rings held in aluminum clamps serve
to connect the cylinders together. The whole construction
turns out very neat and light. The cylinder walls
are 4 mm. or <span class="nowrap"><sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub>&#8242;&#8242;</span> thick and the combustion chamber is of
cylindrical pancake form and is 140 mm. or 5.60 inch in
diameter. The valve seats are 68 mm. in diameter and
the valve port is 62 mm. in diameter.</p>

<p>The passage joining the port is 57 mm. in diameter.
In order to insert the valves into the cylinder the valve
stem is made with two diameters and the valve has to
be cocked to insert it in the guide, which has a bronze
bushing at its upper end to compensate for the smaller
valve stem diameter. The valve stem is 14 mm. or <span class="nowrap"><sup>9</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub>&#8242;&#8242;</span>
in diameter and is reduced at its upper portion to 9<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> mm.
The valves are operated through a push rod and rocker
arm construction, which is <span class="nowrap"><sup>7</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub>&#8242;&#8242;</span> and exceedingly light.
Rocker arm supports are steel studs with enlarged heads
to take a double row ball bearing. A roller is mounted
at one end of the rocker arm to impinge on the end of
the valve stem, and the rocker arm has an adjustable
globe stud at the other end. The push rods are light steel
tubes with a wall thickness of 0.75 mm. and have a hardened
steel cup at their upper end to engage the rocker
arm globe stud and a hardened steel globe at their lower
end to socket in the roller plunger.</p>

<p>The Benz cam-shaft has a diameter of 26 mm. and is
bored straight through 18 mm. and there is a spiral gear
made integrally with the shaft in about the center of its
length for driving the oil pump gear. The cam faces are
10 mm. wide. There is also, in addition to the intake<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span>
and exhaust cams, a set of half compression cams. The
shaft is moved longitudinally in its bearings by means of
an eccentric to put these cams into action. At the fore
end of the shaft is a driving gear flange which is very
small in diameter and very thin. The flange is 68 mm.
in diameter and 4 mm. thick and is tapped to take 6 mm.
bolts. The total length of cam-shaft is 1038 mm., and it
becomes a regular gun boring job to drill a hole of this
length.</p>

<p>The cam-shaft gear is 140 mm. or 5<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches outside
diameter. It has fifty-four teeth and the gear face is 15
mm. or <span class="nowrap"><sup>19</sup>&#8260;<sub>32</sub>&#8242;&#8242;.</span> The flange and web have an average thickness
of 4 mm. or <span class="nowrap"><sup>5</sup>&#8260;<sub>32</sub>&#8242;&#8242;</span> and the web is drilled full of holes
interposed between the spur gear mounted on the cam-shaft
and the cam-shaft gear. There is a gear which
serves to drive the magnetos and tachometer, also the
air pump. The shaft is made integrally with this gear
and has an eccentric portion against which the air pump
roll plunger impinges.</p>

<p>The seven-bearing crank-shaft is finished all over in
a beautiful manner, and the shaft out of the particular
motor we have shows no signs of wear whatever. The
crank-pins are 55 mm. in diameter and 69 mm. long.
Through both the crank-pin and main bearings there is
drilled a 28 mm. hole, and the crank cheeks are plugged
with solder. The crank cheeks are also built to convey
the lubricant to the crank-pins. At the fore end of the
crank cheek there is pressed on a spur driving gear.
There is screwed on to the front end of the shaft a piece
which forms a bevel water pump driving gear and the
starting dog. At the rear end of the shaft very close to
the propeller hub mounting there is a double thrust bearing
to take the propeller thrust.</p>

<p>Long, shouldered studs are screwed into the top half
of the crank-case portion of the case and pass clean
through the bottom half of the case. The case is very
stiff and well ribbed. The three center bearing diaphragms
have double walls. The center one serves as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span>
duct through which water pipe passes, and those on either
side of the center form the carburetor intake air passages
and are enlarged in section at one side to take the carburetor
barrel throttle.</p>

<p>The pistons are of cast iron and carry three concentric
rings <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inch wide on their upper end, which are pinned
at the joint. The top of the piston forms the frustum
of the cone and the pistons are 110 mm. in length. The
lower portion of the skirt is machined inside and has a
wall thickness of 1 mm. Riveted to the piston head is
a conical diaphragm which contacts with the piston pin
when in place and serves to carry the heat off the center
of the piston.</p>

<p>The oil pump assembly comprises a pair of plunger
pumps which draw oil from a separate outside pump, and
constructed integrally with it is a gear pump which delivers
the oil under about 60 pound pressure through a
set of copper pipes in the base to the main bearings. The
plunger oil pump shows great refinement of detail. A
worm wheel and two eccentrics are machined up out of
one piece and serve to operate the plungers.</p>

<h3><a name="SecXII_19" id="SecXII_19"></a>AUSTRO-DAIMLER ENGINE</h3>

<p>One of the first very successful European flying engines
which was developed in Europe is the Austro-Daimler,
which is shown in <a href="#Fig090">end section</a> in a preceding chapter. The
first of these motors had four-cylinders, 120 by 140 millimeters,
bore and stroke, with cast iron cylinders, overhead
valves operated by means of a single rocker arm,
controlled by two cams and the valves were closed by a
single leaf spring which oscillates with the rocker arm.
The cylinders are cast singly and have either copper or
steel jackets applied to them. The four-cylinder design
was afterwards expanded to the six-cylinder design and
still later a six-cylinder motor of 130 by 175 millimeters
was developed. This motor uses an offset crank-shaft,
as does the Benz motor, and the effect of offset has been
discussed earlier on in this treatise. The Benz motor also
uses an offset cam-shaft which improves the valve operation
and changes the valve lift diagram. The lubrication
also is different than any other aviation motor, since<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[558]</a></span>
individual high pressure metering pumps are used to
deliver fresh oil only to the bearings and cylinders, as
was the custom in automobile practice some ten years ago.</p>

<h3><a name="SecXII_20" id="SecXII_20"></a>SUNBEAM AVIATION ENGINES</h3>

<p>These very successful engines have been developed by
Louis Coatalen. At the opening of the war the largest
sized Coatalen motor was 225 horse-power and was of the
L-head type having a single cam-shaft for operating
valves and was an evolution from the twelve-cylinder
racing car which the Sunbeam Company had previously
built. Since 1914 the Sunbeam Company have produced
engines of six-, eight-, twelve- and eighteen-cylinders from
150 to 500 horse-power with both iron and aluminum
cylinders. For the last two years all the motors have had
overhead cam-shafts with a separate shaft for operating
the intake and exhaust valves. Cam-shafts are connected
through to the crank-shaft by means of a train of spur
gears, all of which are mounted on two double row ball
bearings. In the twin six, 350 horse-power engine, operating
at 2100 R.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;M., requires about 4 horse-power
to operate the cam-shafts. This motor gives 362 horsepower
at 2100 revolutions and has a fuel consumption of
<sup>51</sup>&#8260;<sub>100</sub> of a pint per brake horse-power hour. The cylinders
are 110 by 160 millimeters. The same design has been
expanded into an eighteen-cylinder which gives 525 horsepower
at 2100 turns. There has also been developed a
very successful eight-cylinder motor rated at 2220 horsepower
which has a bore and stroke of 120 by 130 millimeters,
weight 450 pounds. This motor is an aluminum
block construction with steel sleeves inserted. Three
valves are operated, one for the inlet and two for the
exhaust. One cam-shaft operates the three valves.</p>

Engine. Below, Side View of Sunbeam 350 Horse-Power
Twelve-Cylinder Vee Engine.</p></div>

<p>The modern Sunbeam engines operate with a mean
effective pressure of 135 pounds with a compression ratio
of 6 to 1 sea level. The connecting rods are of the articulated
type as in the Renault motor and are very short.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[559]</a></span>
The weight of these motors turns out at 2.6 pounds per
brake horse-power, and they are able to go through a
100 hour test without any trouble of any kind. The lubricating
system comprises a dry base and oil pump for
drawing the oil off from the base, whence it is delivered
to the filter and cooling system. It then is pumped by a
separate high pressure gear pump through the entire
motor. In these larger European motors, castor-oil is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_561"
id="Page_561">[561]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560"></a></span>
used largely for lubrication. It is said that without the
use of castor-oil it is impossible to hold full power for
five hours. Coatalen favors aluminum cylinders rather
than cast iron. The series of views in <a href="#Fig247">Figs. 247</a> to <a href="#Fig250">250</a>
inclusive, illustrates the vertical, narrow type of engine;
the V-form; and the broad arrow type wherein three
rows, each of six-cylinders, are set on a common crank-case.
In this water-cooled series the gasoline and oil
consumption are notably low, as is the weight per horse-power.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 249.&mdash;Sunbeam Eighteen-Cylinder Motor, Viewed from Pump and

<p>In the eighteen-cylinder overhead valve Sunbeam-Coatalen
aircraft engine of 475 brake horse-power, there
are no fewer than half a dozen magnetos. Each magneto
is inclosed. Two sparks are furnished to each cylinder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span>
from independent magnetos. On this engine there are
also no fewer than six carburetors. Shortness of crank-shaft,
and therefore of engine length, and absence of
vibration are achieved by the linking of the connecting-rods.
Those concerned with three-cylinders in the broad
arrow formation work on one crank-pin, the outer rods
being linked to the central master one. In consequence
of this arrangement, the piston travel in the case of the
central row of cylinders is 160 mm., while the stroke of
the pistons of the cylinders set on either side is in each
case 168 mm. Inasmuch as each set of six-cylinders is
completely balanced in itself, this difference in stroke
does not affect the balance of the engine as a whole. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[563]</a></span>
duplicate ignition scheme also applies to the twelve-cylinder
350 brake horse-power Sunbeam-Coatalen overhead
valve aircraft engine type. It is distinguishable,
incidentally, by the passage formed through the center of
each induction pipe for the sparking plug in the center
cylinder of each block of three. In this, as in the eighteen-cylinder
and the six-cylinder types, there are two cam-shafts
for each set of cylinders. These cam-shafts are
lubricated by low pressure and are operated through a
train of inclosed spur wheels at the magneto end of the
machine. The six-cylinder, 170 brake horse-power vertical
type employs the same general principles, including the
detail that each carburetor serves gas to a group of three-cylinders
only. It will be observed that this engine presents
notably little head resistance, being suitable for
multi-engined aircraft.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 251.&mdash;View of Airplane Cowl Board, Showing the Various Navigating and Indicating Instruments to Aid the
Aviator in Flight.</p></div>

<p>The proper functioning of the power plant and the
various groups comprising it may be readily ascertained
at any time by the pilot because various indicating meters
and pressure gauges are provided which are located on a
dash or cowl board in front of the aviator, as shown at
<a href="#Fig251">Fig. 251</a>. The speed indicator corresponds to the speedometer
of an automobile and gives an indication of the speed
the airplane is making, which taken in conjunction with the
clock will make it possible to determine the distance covered
at a flight. The altimeter, which is an aneroid
barometer, outlines with fair accuracy the height above
the ground at which a plane is flying. These instruments
are furnished to enable the aviator to navigate the airplane
when in the air, and if the machine is to be used
for cross-country flying, they may be supplemented by a
compass and a drift set. It will be evident that these
are purely navigating instruments and only indicate the
motor condition in an indirect manner. The best way of
keeping track of the motor action is to watch the tachometer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[565]</a></span>
or revolution counter which is driven from the
engine by a flexible shaft. This indicates directly the
number of revolutions the engine is making per minute
and, of course, any slowing up of the engine in normal
flights indicates that something is not functioning as it
should. The tachometer operates on the same principle
as the speed indicating device or speedometer used in
automobiles except that the dial is calibrated to show
revolutions per minute instead of miles per hour. At the
extreme right of the dash at <a href="#Fig251">Fig. 251</a> the spark advance
and throttle control levers are placed. These, of course,
regulate the motor speed just as they do in an automobile.
Next to the engine speed regulating levers is placed a
push button cut-out switch to cut out the ignition and
stop the motor. Three pressure gauges are placed in a
line. The one at the extreme right indicates the pressure
of air on the fuel when a pressure feed system is used.
The middle one shows oil pressure, while that nearest
the center of the dash board is employed to show the air
pressure available in the air starting system. It will be
evident that the character of the indicating instruments
will vary with the design of the airplane. If it was provided
with an electrical starter instead of an air system
electrical indicating instruments would have to be provided.</p>

<h3><a name="SecXII_22" id="SecXII_22"></a>COMPRESSED AIR-STARTING SYSTEMS</h3>

<p>Two forms of air-starting systems are in general use,
one in which the crank-shaft is turned by means of an
air motor, the other class where compressed air is admitted
to the cylinders proper and the motor turned over
because of the air pressure acting on the engine pistons.
A system known as the &#8220;Never-Miss&#8221; utilizes a small
double-cylinder air pump is driven from the engine by
means of suitable gearing and supplies air to a substantial
container located at some convenient point in the
fuselage. The air is piped from the container to a dash-control
valve and from this member to a peculiar form<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[566]</a></span>
of air motor mounted near the crank-shaft. The air
motor consists of a piston to which a rack is fastened
which engages a gear mounted on the crank shaft provided
with some form of ratchet clutch to permit it to
revolve only in one direction, and then only when the
gear is turning faster than the engine crank-shaft.</p>

<p>The method of operation is extremely simple, the
dash-control valve admitting air from the supply tank
to the top of the pump cylinder. When in the position
shown in cut the air pressure will force the piston and
rack down and set the engine in motion. A variety of
air motors are used and in some the pump and motor may
be the same device, means being provided to change the
pump to an air motor when the engine is to be turned over.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Christensen&#8221; air starting system is shown at
<a href="#Fig252">Figs. 252</a> and <a href="#Fig253">253</a>. An air pump is driven by the engine,
and this supplies air to an air reservoir or container
attached to the fuselage. This container communicates
with the top of an air distributor when a suitable control
valve is open. An air pressure gauge is provided to
enable one to ascertain the air pressure available. The
top of each cylinder is provided with a check valve,
through which air can flow only in one direction, i.e., from
the tank to the interior of the cylinder. Under explosive
pressure these check valves close. The function of the
distributor is practically the same as that of an ignition
timer, its purpose being to distribute the air to the cylinders
of the engine only in the proper firing order. All
the while that the engine is running and the car is in
motion the air pump is functioning, unless thrown out of
action by an easily manipulated automatic control. When
it is desired to start the engine a starting valve is opened
which permits the air to flow to the top of the distributor,
and then through a pipe to the check valve on top of the
cylinder about to explode. As the air is going through
under considerable pressure it will move the piston down
just as the explosion would, and start the engine rotating.
The inside of the distributor rotates and directs a charge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[567]</a></span>
of air to the cylinder next to fire. In this way the engine
is given a number of revolutions, and finally a charge of
gas will be ignited and the engine start off on its cycle of
operation. To make starting positive and easier some
gasoline is injected in with the air so an inflammable mixture
is present in the cylinders instead of air only. This
ignites easily and the engine starts off sooner than would
otherwise be the case. The air pressure required varies
from 125 to 250 pounds per square inch, depending upon
the size and type of the engine to be set in motion.</p>

<h3><a name="SecXII_23" id="SecXII_23"></a>ELECTRIC STARTING SYSTEMS</h3>

<p>Starters utilizing electric motors to turn over the
engine have been recently developed, and when properly
made and maintained in an efficient condition they answer
all the requirements of an ideal starting device.
The capacity is very high, as the motor may draw current
from a storage battery and keep the engine turning
over for considerable time on a charge. The objection
against their use is that it requires considerable complicated
and costly apparatus which is difficult to understand
and which requires the services of an expert electrician
to repair should it get out of order, though if battery
ignition is used the generator takes the place of the
usual ignition magneto.</p>

<p>In the Delco system the electric current is generated
by a combined motor-generator permanently geared to
the engine. When the motor is running it turns the
armature and the motor generator is acting as a dynamo,
only supplying current to a storage battery. On account
of the varying speeds of the generator, which are due to
the fluctuation in engine speed, some form of automatic
switch which will disconnect the generator from the battery
at such times that the motor speed is not sufficiently
high to generate a current stronger than that delivered
by the battery is needed. These automatic switches are
the only delicate part of the entire apparatus, and while
they require very delicate adjustment they seem to perform
very satisfactorily in practice.</p>

<p>When it is desired to start the engine an electrical
connection is established between the storage battery and
the motor-generator unit, and this acts as a motor and
turns the engine over by suitable gearing which engages
the gear teeth cut into a special gear or disc attached to
the engine crank-shaft. When the motor-generator furnishes
current for ignition as well as for starting the
motor, the fact that the current can be used for this work
as well as starting justifies to a certain extent the rather<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[570]</a></span>
complicated mechanism which forms a complete starting
and ignition system, and which may also be used for lighting
if necessary in night flying.</p>

<p>An electric generator and motor do not complete a
self-starting system, because some reservoir or container
for electric current must be provided. The current from
the generator is usually stored in a storage battery from
which it can be made to return to the motor or to the
same armature that produced it. The fundamental units
of a self-starting system, therefore, are a generator to
produce the electricity, a storage battery to serve as a
reservoir, and an electric motor to rotate the motor crank-shaft.
Generators are usually driven by enclosed gearing,
though silent chains are used where the center distance
between the motor shaft and generator shaft is too
great for the gears. An electric starter may be directly
connected to the gasoline engine, as is the case where the
combined motor-generator replaces the fly-wheel in an
automobile engine. The motor may also drive the engine
by means of a silent chain or by direct gear reduction.</p>

<p>Every electric starter must use a switch of some kind
for starting purposes and most systems include an output
regulator and a reverse current cut-out. The output
regulator is a simple device that regulates the strength
of the generator current that is supplied the storage battery.
A reverse current cut-out is a form of check
valve that prevents the storage battery from discharging
through the generator. Brief mention is made of electric
starting because such systems will undoubtedly be incorporated
in some future airplane designs. Battery ignition
is already being experimented with.</p>

<h3><a name="SecXII_24" id="SecXII_24"></a>BATTERY IGNITION SYSTEM PARTS</h3>

<p>A battery ignition system in its simplest form consists
of a current producer, usually a set of dry cells or a
storage battery, an induction coil to transform the low
tension current to one having sufficient strength to jump<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[571]</a></span>
the air gap at the spark-plug, an igniter member placed
in the combustion chamber and a timer or mechanical
switch operated by the engine so that the circuit will be
closed only when it is desired to have a spark take place
in the cylinders. Battery ignition systems may be of two
forms, those in which the battery current is stepped up
or intensified to enable it to jump an air gap between the
points of the spark plug, these being called &#8220;high tension&#8221;
systems and the low tension form (never used on
airplane motors) in which the battery current is not intensified
to a great degree and a spark produced in the cylinder
by the action of a mechanical circuit breaker in the
combustion chamber. The low tension system is the simplest
electrically but the more complex mechanically.
The high tension system has the fewest moving parts but
numerous electrical devices. At the present time all airplane
engines use high tension ignition systems, the magneto
being the most popular at the present time. The
current distribution and timing devices used with modern
battery systems are practically the same as similar parts
of a magneto.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572"></a></span></p>

1918 Edition.</b> By <span class="smcap">Victor W. Pag&eacute;</span>, M.S.A.E.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This is the most complete, practical and up-to-date treatise on gasoline automobiles and their
component parts ever published. In the new <i>revised</i> and <i>enlarged</i> 1918 <i>edition</i>, all phases of
automobile construction, operation and maintenance are fully and completely described, and
in language anyone can understand. Every part of all types of automobiles, from light cycle-cars
to heavy motor trucks and tractors, are described in a thorough manner, not only
the automobile, but every item of it; equipment, accessories, tools needed, supplies and spare
parts necessary for its upkeep, are fully discussed.</p>

<p><i>It is clearly and concisely written by an expert familiar with every branch of the automobile industry
and the originator of the practical system of self-education on technical subjects. It is a liberal education
in the automobile art, useful to all who motor for either business or pleasure.</i></p>

<p>Anyone reading the incomparable treatise is in touch with all improvements that have been
made in motor-car construction. All latest developments, such as high speed aluminum motors
and multiple valve and sleeve-valve engines, are considered in detail. The latest ignition,
carburetor and lubrication practice is outlined. New forms of change speed gears, and final
power transmission systems, and all latest chassis improvements are shown and described.
This book is used in all leading automobile schools and is conceded to be the <span class="smcap">Standard
Treatise</span>. The chapter on Starting and Lighting Systems has been greatly enlarged, and
many automobile engineering features that have long puzzled laymen are explained so clearly
that the underlying principles can be understood by anyone. This book was first published
six years ago and so much new matter has been added that it is nearly twice, its original size.

Woodworth</span>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This is a practical treatise on Modern Shop Practice, Processes, Methods, Machine Tools,
and Details treating on the Hot and Cold Machine-Forming of Steel and Iron into Finished
Shapes: together with Tools, Dies, and Machinery involved in the manufacture of Duplicate
Forgings and Interchangeable Hot and Cold Pressed Parts from Bar and Sheet Metal. This
book fills a demand of long standing for information regarding drop-forgings, die-sinking and
machine-forming of steel and the shop practice involved, as it actually exists in the modern
drop-forging shop. The processes of die-sinking and force-making, which are thoroughly
described and illustrated in this admirable work, are rarely to be found explained in such a
clear and concise manner as is here set forth. The process of die-sinking relates to the engraving
or sinking of the female or lower dies, such as are used for drop-forgings, hot and cold
machine-forging, swedging, and the press working of metals. The process of force-making
relates to the engraving or raising of the male or upper dies used in producing the lower dies
for the press-forming and machine-forging of duplicate parts of metal.</p>

<p>In addition to the arts above mentioned the book contains explicit information regarding the
drop-forging and hardening plants, designs, conditions, equipment, drop hammers, forging
machines, etc., machine forging, hydraulic forging, autogenous welding and shop practice.
The book contains eleven chapters, and the information contained in these chapters is just
what will prove most valuable to the forged-metal worker. All operations described in the
work are thoroughly illustrated by means of perspective half-tones and outline sketches of
the machinery employed. 300 detailed illustrations. Price <span class="price">$2.50</span></p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This is a practical treatise on Mechanical Drawing and Machine Design, comprising the first
principles of geometric and mechanical drawing, workshop mathematics, mechanics, strength
of materials and the calculations and design of machine details. The author&#8217;s aim has been
to adapt this treatise to the requirements of the practical mechanic and young draftsman
and to present the matter in as clear and concise a manner as possible. To meet the demands
of this class of students, practically all the important elements of machine design have been
dealt with, and in addition algebraic formulas have been explained, and the elements of
trigonometry treated in the manner best suited to the needs of the practical man. The book
is divided into 20 chapters, and in arranging the material, mechanical drawing, pure and simple,
has been taken up first, as a thorough understanding of the principles of representing objects
facilitates the further study of mechanical subjects. This is followed by the mathematics
necessary for the solution of the problems in machine design which are presented later, and a
practical introduction to theoretical mechanics and the strength of materials. The various
elements entering into machine design, such as cams, gears, sprocket-wheels, cone pulleys,
bolts, screws, couplings, clutches, shafting and fly-wheels, have been treated in such a way
as to make possible the use of the work as a text-book for a continuous course of study. It
is easily comprehended and assimilated even by students of limited previous training. 330

possession of all who desire to keep abreast with the progress of this branch of science. In
its arrangement and typography the book is very convenient. The word or term defined is
printed in black-faced type, which readily catches the eye, while the body of the page is in
smaller but distinct type. The definitions are well worded, and so as to be understood by the
non-technical reader. The general plan seems to be to give an exact, concise definition, and
then amplify and explain in a more popular way. Synonyms are also given, and references
to other words and phrases are made. A very complete and accurate index of fifty pages
is at the end of the volume; and as this index contains all synonyms, and as all phrases are
indexed in every reasonable combination of words, reference to the proper place in the body
of the book is readily made. It is difficult to decide how far a book of this character is to
keep the dictionary form, and to what extent it may assume the encyclopedia form. For
some purposes, concise, exactly worded definitions are needed; for other purposes, more
extended descriptions are required. This book seeks to satisfy both demands, and does it
with considerable success. 682 pages, 393 illustrations. 12th Edition.

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>We publish two books by Gardner D. Hiscox that will keep you from &#8220;inventing&#8221; things that have
been done before, and suggest ways of doing things that you have not thought of before. Many a
man spends time and money pondering over some mechanical problem, only to learn, after he
has solved the problem, that the same thing has been accomplished and put in practice by others
long before. Time and money spent in an effort to accomplish what has already been accomplished
are time and money LOST. The whole field of mechanics, every known mechanical movement,
and practically every device are covered by these two books. If the thing you want has been invented,
it is illustrated in them. If it hasn&#8217;t been invented, then you&#8217;ll find in them the nearest things
to what you want, some movements or devices that will apply in your case, perhaps; or which
will give you a key from which to work. No book or set of books ever published is of more real

Bauer</span>, <span class="smcap">Leslie S. Robertson</span> and <span class="smcap">S. Bryan Donkin</span>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In the words of Dr. Bauer, the present work owes its origin to an oft felt want of a condensed
treatise embodying the theoretical and practical rules used in designing marine engines and
boilers. The need of such a work has been felt by most engineers engaged in the construction
and working of marine engines, not only by the younger men, but also by those of greater experience.
The fact that the original German work was written by the chief engineer of the
famous Vulcan Works, Stettin, is in itself a guarantee that this book is in all respects thoroughly
up-to-date, and that it embodies all the information which is necessary for the design
and construction of the highest types of marine engines and boilers. It may be said that the
motive power which Dr. Bauer has placed in the fast German liners that have been turned out
of late years from the Stettin Works represent the very best practice in marine engineering of
the present day. The work is clearly written, thoroughly systematic, theoretically sound;
while the character of the plans, drawings, tables, and statistics is without reproach. The
illustrations are careful reproductions from actual working drawings, with some well-executed
photographic views of completed engines and boilers. 744 pages, 550 illustrations and numerous
tables. Cloth. Price <b>$9.00 net</b></p></div>

<h2>STEEL</h2>

<p><b>Steel: Its Selection, Annealing, Hardening, and Tempering.</b> By <span class="smcap">E. R.
Markham</span>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This work was formerly known as &#8220;The American Steel Worker,&#8221; but on the publication
of the new, revised edition, the publishers deemed it advisable to change its title to a more
suitable one. It is the standard work on Hardening, Tempering, and Annealing Steel of all kinds.
This book tells how to select, and how to work, temper, harden, and anneal steel for everything
on earth. It doesn&#8217;t tell how to temper one class of tools and then leave the treatment
of another kind of tool to your imagination and judgment, but it gives careful instructions
for every detail of every tool, whether it be a tap, a reamer or just a screw-driver. It tells
about the tempering of small watch springs, the hardening of cutlery, and the annealing of
dies. In fact, there isn&#8217;t a thing that a steel worker would want to know that isn&#8217;t included.
It is the standard book on selecting, hardening and tempering all grades of steel. Among
the chapter headings might be mentioned the following subjects: Introduction; the workman;
steel; methods of heating; heating tool steel; forging; annealing; hardening baths;
baths for hardening; hardening steel; drawing the temper after hardening; examples of
hardening; pack hardening; case hardening; spring tempering; making tools of machine
steel; special steels; steel for various tools; causes of trouble; high-speed steels, etc. 400
pages. Very fully illustrated. Fourth edition. Price <span class="price">$2.50</span></p></div>

<h2>TURBINES</h2>

<p><b>Marine Steam Turbines.</b> By <span class="smcap">Dr. G. Bauer</span> and <span class="smcap">O. Lasche</span>. Assisted by
<span class="smcap">E. Ludwig</span> and <span class="smcap">H. Vogel</span>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Translated from the German and edited by M. G. S. Swallow. The book is essentially practical
and discusses turbines in which the full expansion of steam passes through a number
of separate turbines arranged for driving two or more shafts, as in the Parsons system, and
turbines in which the complete expansion of steam from inlet to exhaust pressure occurs in
a turbine on one shaft, as in the case of the Curtis machines. It will enable a designer to
carry out all the ordinary calculation necessary for the construction of steam turbines, hence
it fills a want which is hardly met by larger and more theoretical works. Numerous tables,
curves and diagrams will be found, which explain with remarkable lucidity the reason why
turbine blades are designed as they are, the course which steam takes through turbines of
various types, the thermodynamics of steam turbine calculation, the influence of vacuum
on steam consumption of steam turbines, etc. In a word, the very information which a designer
and builder of steam turbines most requires. Large octavo, 214 pages. Fully illustrated
and containing eighteen tables, including an entropy chart. Price, net <span class="price">$3.50</span></p></div>

498 pages and is intended as a workshop companion for those engaged in watch-making and
allied mechanical arts. Nearly 250 engravings and fourteen plates are included. This is
the standard work on watch-making. Price <span class="price">$3.00</span></p></div>

<h2>WELDING</h2>

<p><b>Automobile Welding with the Oxy-Acetylene Flame.</b> By <span class="smcap">M. Keith Dunham</span>.</p>

shop equipment. Proceeds then to the actual welding of all automobile parts, in a manner
understandable by every one. <i>Gives principles never to be forgotten.</i> Aluminum, cast iron,
steel, copper, brass, bronze, and malleable iron are fully treated, as well as a clear explanation
of the proper manner to burn the carbon out of the combustion head. This book is of
utmost value, since the perplexing problems arising when metal is heated to a melting point
are fully explained and the proper methods to overcome them shown. 167 pages, fully illustrated.

<p class="center fsize175"><b>Everyday Engineering</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A monthly magazine devoted to practical mechanics for everyday men.
Its aim is to popularize engineering as a science, teaching the elements
of applied mechanics and electricity in a straightforward and understandable
manner. The magazine maintains its own experimental laboratory where
the devices described in articles submitted to the Editor are first tried out and
tested before they are published. This important innovation places the standard
of the published material very high, and it insures accuracy and dependability.</p>

<p>The magazine is the only one in this country that specializes in practical
model building. Articles in past issues have given comprehensive designs for
many model boats, including submarines and chasers, model steam and gasoline
engines, electric motors and generators, etc., etc. This feature is a permanent
one in this magazine.</p>

<p>Another popular department is that devoted to automobiles and airplanes.
Care, maintenance, and operation receive full and authoritative treatment. Every
article is written from the practical, everyday man, standpoint rather than from
that of the professional.</p>

<p>The magazine entertains while it instructs. It is a journal of practical, dependable
information given in such a style that it may be readily assimilated
and applied by the man with little or no technical training. The aim is to place
before the man who leans toward practical mechanics, a series of concise, crisp,
readable talks on what is going on and <i>how it is done</i>. These articles are profusely
illustrated with clear, snappy photographs, specially posed to illustrate the subject
in the magazine&#8217;s own studio by its own staff of technically-trained illustrators
and editors.</p>

<p><b>The subscription price of the magazine is one dollar per year of twelve numbers.

<h2><a name="TN" id="TN"></a>Transcriber&#8217;s Notes</h2>

<p>General remarks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Where the small illustrations are not clear enough to see all details in the drawings, hyperlinks in the left margin link to larger
      scale images.</li>
  <li>Some page numbers are missing due to full-page illustrations having been moved around.</li>
  <li>There are some differences in wording between the Table of Contents, the lists of sections per chapter, and the actual section
      titles. Their meaning is clear, and they have been left as they were in the original work. The hyperlinks link to the proper sections
      or paragraphs.</li>
  <li>Some in-line multi-line formulas have been transcribed as single-line formulas, where necessary with brackets added.</li>
  <li>Page 56, table: Fig. 8 in the first column does not refer to Fig. 8 in this work.</li>
  <li>Page 186, Fig. 67: the dimensions in the lower right corner are partly illegible, they possibly read <i>(4) <span
      class="nowrap"><sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>&#8242;&#8242;</span> 16 Tap <span
      class="nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>&#8242;&#8242;</span> Deep U. S. St'd. Threads</i>.</li>
  <li>The original work does not have a Figure 89.</li>
  <li>Page 283, Fig. 113: the dimension <span class="nowrap">4&#8242;&#8242;</span> should probably refer to the cylinder diameter (if
      drawing is to scale), not to the cylinder diameter plus part of the large valve as in the drawing.</li>
  <li>Page 303, table: it is uncertain what <i>free with kerosene</i> means, there may be a word omitted.</li>
  <li>Page 544, entirely censored. It is not clear what this page originally contained (possibly a table), since text and numbering of
      illustrations are uninterrupted. The text <i>CENSORED</i> has been moved to after the first paragraph of the section on Mercedes
      Engines.</li>
  <li>The List of Illustrations does not occur in the original work.</li>
</ul>

<p>Changes made:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The text of the original work (including inconsistencies in accents, spelling, hyphenation and lay-out, and differences between the
      main text, illustrations and advertisements) has been followed, except when listed below. Only some minor obvious typographical
      errors have been corrected silently.</li>
  <li>Where the author used <i>x</i> for multiplication, this has been replaced by <i>&times;</i> in the body of the text (not in the
      advertisements or illustrations).</li>
  <li>The illustrations have been moved so as not to disrupt the flow of the text.</li>
  <li>Engine and aircraft types are not always named consistently in the original; Curtiss engine O X 2, OX-2, 0X2 and 0 X 2 have all been
      changed to OX-2, Curtiss aircraft JN4 and JN-4 to JN-4.</li>
  <li>Multi-page tables: repeated headings have been removed, and the tables treated as one consecutive table.</li>
  <li>Page 22: <i>The product of</i> has been moved into the first formula.</li>
  <li>Page 25: <i>When B &times; r = M</i> changed to <i>When P &times; r = M</i>.</li>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
